In a Pickle,"['""Loopy, lovely and almost impossibly good-humored...The company has made a lot of cuts in \'The Winter’s Tale\'...Not much of the original story is left...There was very little clamoring, a testament to the company’s talent and care. If you have a child or have been a child, you’ll know that kids are a tough crowd...Oily Cart understands this, which is why they keep \'In a Pickle\' friendly, focused and fast-moving."" ', 'for a previous production""A joyous theatrical experience for children ages 3 – 5 and adults alike...A wondrous boat journey across a magical ocean ensues, and little hands can even explore fish-filled pools of water as we travel. Oily Cart really are masters at immersive, original and important theatre-making for young audiences. Not only that, they really cater to the grown-ups too. This story was moving and magical. Who says 3 isn’t the perfect age to fall in love with Shakespeare?"" ', 'for a previous production""The interaction between the characters on stage was full of warmth and silliness, and easily appeals to our emotions...The show sparkles with the sharpness of its imagination and the clarity of its design, and it is for this reason that watching is a delight for children and adults alike...It was a reminder of how good and useful immersive theatre can be...As a result of the intelligent relationship created between performer and audience, the show resonates on many levels."" ', 'for a previous production""Though not much of the original play remains, Oily Cart’s version brings Shakespeare to life, with the audience engaging as collaborators and interacting with characters; guiding the action as they suggest ways to soothe and look after the newly found infant...Though Shakespeare for the very young might seem an impossible challenge, it is skillfully met and mastered by Oily Cart in what continues to be a rich, gorgeous production."" ', 'for a previous production""A cleverly crafted original, not watered-down Shakespeare...It is a show full of visual, aural and contact experience, as delightful for accompanying adults as for its target audience, but, like all Oily Cart performances, is guided by careful observation of audience members to approach them in a way that is welcome and sensitive to individual responses.""

On the Exhale,"['""Marin Ireland is armed only with Martín Zimmerman\'s text and her own formidable talent, but it\'s enough to leave us thoroughly shaken...I won\'t swear that, without an actress as fiercely committed as Ireland, \'On the Exhale\' might not seem rather melodramatic, but Zimmerman has a poet\'s touch...The director, Leigh Silverman, keeps a firm hand on the proceedings, never letting the experience become exploitative...It is the most harrowing sixty minutes in New York at the moment."" ', '“For the first few minutes of this extraordinary play, Marin Ireland rushes through the text and uses some old saws of expression that feel like leftovers from other productions. Luckily this does not last long, and soon Ms. Ireland is not only in full control, she has chosen a direction to take and is unhesitant about leading us to her destination...Where writer Martín Zimmerman and director by Leigh Silverman guide the story has a depth and stunning resonance.” ', ""“The mother in ‘On the Exhale’ is played by the brilliant Marin Ireland, who, under Leigh Silverman's delicate direction, has never been better…Ireland so persuasively conveys the mother's grief that there were moments when I literally shook with the sorrow and the rage that having a beloved so savagely ripped away would arouse. It's not that I didn't know intellectually what the horror of such an experience might be but ‘On the Exhale’ made me feel it.” "", '""A remarkable one-hour, one-woman monologue by the enchanting actress Marin Ireland inspired by the heinous school shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The subject has been explored before, but never with this much emotional power. It’s a one-hour session in electroshock therapy without leaving your seat...\'On the Exhale\' is a shattering experience in the presence of a cogent, captivating actress who deserves a bigger audience."" ', '""Zimmerman’s powerful show about a woman devastated by the most tragic gun violence hits every emotion of fear, tragedy, loss, and revenge. But it never becomes predictable and offers enough twists to keep you constantly riveted...Though the language tries to be detached, Ireland is deeply engaged in every word, motion, and emotion. Ireland is emerging as one of our great character actresses...Ireland is captivating and has all the power she needs—with or without a gun."" ', '""Dealing with the issue of gun violence in America in compelling fashion, ‘On the Exhale’ never feels like it’s preaching to the choir...Maintaining a relentless tension without lapsing into histrionics or melodrama, ‘On the Exhale’ makes its points succinctly and intelligently. Ireland, one of New York theater\'s most invaluable performers, delivers superb work that is all the more affecting for its carefully calibrated restraint. Silverman’s direction of the piece is similarly understated.” ', '""Marin Ireland, one of our most talented stage actors, seems incapable of giving a less than compelling performance...While the acting is impeccable, the material seemed a bit formulaic. During the last 15 minutes, the play took what I felt was a wrong turn that undermined some of its force...Leigh Silverman’s unfussy direction is assured. It’s only an hour long, but it’s a very intense hour."" ', '""This uncomfortable but important topic is made palatable by a wonderful team comprised of actor Marin Ireland, playwright Martín Zimmerman, and director Leigh Silverman, who brilliantly present the nuances of a woman going through something unimaginable...Directed with a light touch by Silverman, \'On The Exhale\' has an intimacy that feels more like a therapy session than a play. The drama is there but Ireland doesn’t play it up."" ', '""Composed in a lucid style by Martín Zimmerman and unobtrusively directed by Leigh Silverman, the material is sometimes too lumbering in convincing us of the professor’s 180-turn towards gun nuttery...But New York stage veteran Ireland gives a characteristically live-wire, throttling performance...There are a few moments during the final stretch of \'On the Exhale\' where she turns so unnerving and unpredictable that we don’t know what to expect."" ', '""As directed with characteristic sensitivity by the ever-busy Leigh Silverman, ‘On the Exhale’ provides a welcome opportunity to see an artist of Ms. Ireland’s caliber take a character through the stages of grief…It’s a brave and bold premise for a play. And if ‘On the Exhale’ never quite fulfills its potential to unsettle, it’s because Mr. Zimmerman’s authorial hand is too much in evidence — meticulously setting up the back story and balancing patterns of imagery."" ', '""As a moral construct, \'On the Exhale\' has weight, but as a play, it falters. Zimmerman is skilled: he shows a cinematic attention to detail and has a clever way of using storytelling techniques to shift focus and keep us disoriented. But ultimately, the characterization rings false...Ireland\'s thrumming voice makes the short-story-cum-soliloquy slip through our defenses despite its unlikelihoods...It might not be till later that you realize how the text was so wide of its mark."" ', '""Ireland is superb; she\'s a fastidiously intelligent actress, and that intelligence, so right for this professor, stands in captivating contrast to the visceral warmth that emerges when she takes life and death quite literally into her own hands...This fusion of acting, direction, and writing is \'On the Exhale\' at its best, because it levels out a piece that is otherwise rocky...Well-meaning but well-worn pabulum."" ', '""Zimmerman\'s decision to indulge in formal gimmickry keeps the play from ever hitting the bull\'s-eye...We don\'t get the sense that the stakes are life-or-death...We are always acutely aware that she is reciting poetry. This problem is compounded by Leigh Silverman\'s stripped-down production...There are moments of simmering intensity…Sadly, ‘On the Exhale’ always takes a breath and backs off the ledge.

"Kiss Me, Kate","['""It’s smashing. The production has gained some points for its conscientious effort to drain the show of its purported sexism...But beyond that is the production’s appreciation of ‘Kiss Me, Kate’ as a knock-’em-dead entertainment, with one glorious Porter song after another, the buoyancy and shrewdness of the book, and its opportunities to dazzle with production numbers....O’Hara is the centerpiece...Her singing has never been more brilliant.” ', '""While many of the greats have tackled \'Kate\' over the years ever since it premiered in 1948, O\'Hara brings a subdued charm to the usually more boisterous part of Lilli, even if she is positively beaming when she first arrives on stage. The first was Patricia Morison, and the most recent on Broadway--before O\'Hara--was the late Marin Mazzie, who received a Tony Award for the 1999 revival, as did the revival itself. And then there was Kathryn Grayson in the 1953 film version."" ', '""I’m happy to report that Scott Ellis’s 2019 edition is smashing. The slight but important tweaks to Bella Spewack’s book and Mr. Porter’s lyrics have gone a long way in updating the material...Carlyle’s exuberant and unexpectedly steamy choreographed provides a robust counterpoint to Ellis’s gentler view of the show, which makes for a beautifully balanced and well-rounded evening at the theater. Ellis’s vision is carried out sensationally by his top-tier cast."" ', '""A famous Cole Porter musical gets the misogyny pulled out and finds what\'s left to be fun and a little bit magical. Do not miss Kelli O\'Hara and a fantastic ensemble of singers and dancers in \'Kiss Me Kate.\' It\'s an old fashioned show with broad laughs, big dance numbers and obvious endings, yet somehow it seems fresh."" ', '""Roundabout has whipped up a fizzy champagne cocktail in its revival of \'Kiss Me, Kate,\' an adult entertainment firmly focused on the finer things in life...There are at least two reasons why Scott Ellis\' revival breezes across the Studio 54 stage like a fire engine on a five-alarm call: One is the effervescent pairing of Kelli O\'Hara and Will Chase...Production numbers, staged by Carlyle, that feature some of the most sensational dancing since I don\'t know when."" ', '""Terrifically performed and staged as this revival is, the kids are more than likely to now see that there is indeed something quite \'wunderbar\' about this show...This two-tiered story is thrillingly fresh and new. Director Ellis downplays their bickering and focus on their musical reminiscences and thus give full rein to O\'Hara\'s gorgeous soprano and ability to effortlessly scale some of Porter\'s trills...Highly recommended for 9 to 90-year-olds."" ', '""It’s a measure of how skillfully director Scott Ellis and book-tweaker Amanda Green navigate the antique attitudes of the material that we view the vicious scrapping of these ex-spouses as hilarious, not creepy or lopsided...This version softens the lady-bashing while not sacrificing the sexiness and humor. Above all, it’s acted and staged with consummate style and grace...Overall, choreographer Warren Carlyle’s routines are spectacular, performed by a winning ensemble."" ', '""\'Bellissimo,\' sings Kelli O\'Hara towards the end of the Scott Ellis\' exuberant revival of \'Kiss Me, Kate,\' and I can think of no better word in any language to describe the beauty of this Broadway megastar. I\'m not just speaking of her stunning face and figure (costumed to perfection by Mahshie) or her flawless vocalizing (you\'ll never hear a better version of Cole Porter\'s heartbreaking \'So In Love\') but also her (admittedly surprising) comic timing and (not so surprising) smoking passion."" ', '""A snappy, scintillating, and decidedly woke new production at Studio 54 and featuring an altogether smashing cast headed up by Kelli O\'Hara (never better!) and Will Chase...Even if you are a Porter or Shakespeare purist, if you leave your high horse in the stable and join the crowd, you will have a wonderful time. Where to begin heaping praise? Well, how about with Kelli O\'Hara, whose performances have graced musical revivals for more than a decade."" ', '""It’s so damned entertaining, joyously staged and performed that the minor politically correct tweaks to its book hardly matter. Cole Porter’s classic score is given the evergreen treatment by music director Paul Gemignani, Scott Ellis’ production is crisp, clean, and sleek and Warren Carlyle’s choreography is athletic, humorous and sexy. The fabulous Kelli O’Hara and the comically virile Will Chase lead a dazzling cast full of snappy dancers, riotous clowns, and clashing lovers."" ', '""Big, boisterous, brawling \'Kiss Me, Kate\' is a revival to fall for...Thanks to some subtle tweaks and re-staging, it\'s the story that\'s getting tamed without losing any of its ferocious bite!...Director Ellis staged the classic with great care, respecting its historical roots while shifting the gender dynamic just enough to put the two leads on equal footing...O’Hara deserves...our eternal worship for gracing us with two and a half glorio hours in this altogether wunderbar production.""  ', '“A slightly-revised version of the iconic musical comedy...Performed with inexhaustible pizzazz by a dazzling cast...Delivering the comedy and heart of the narrative and wowing with their extraordinary talents...Roundabout’s smartly-tweaked presentation of ‘Kiss Me, Kate’ gives new life to an undeniable Broadway classic, while subtly reminding us of the progress women have made, since Shakespeare’s time and the 1940s. Win/win. Don’t miss it.” ', '""The revival seems to prove, yet again, that it’s possible for a visionary creative team to whip up a fresh confection from ingredients that have surely passed their expiration date...Director Ellis...dishes up gobs of flash and sizzle. Dazzling choreography by Carlyle does too...Ellis smartly finesses the dated story so that our sympathies lie firmly with its heroine...But the production shines thanks in large part to O’Hara, who remains one of the finest vocalists working today."" ', '""A new, first-class Broadway version that at times raises its sparkle quotient to incandescence. Director Scott Ellis and choreographer Warren Carlyle apply so much sizzling flair to their revival of the 1948 show that it has restored my faith in efforts to mount golden-age musicals with books that have, well, seen better days...There is that creamy O’Hara coloratura, too, to sing us all into happy submission and apply to this revival an apropos adjective: unmissable."" ', '""Toward the end of this season of so-so musicals, \'Kiss Me, Kate\' offers a Broadway revival that strikes gold with melodies as lush as \'So in Love\'...Under the hand of music director Paul Gemignani, the songs flow with sense and sensuousness...Cole Porter’s 1948 masterpiece of dramatic romance and ribald sass is still \'Wunderbar!\' over 70 years later.""  ', '""This newly-recalibrated version directed by Scott Ellis at Roundabout Theatre changes all that. Now it\'s a clash of equals — and the result is delicious...A cast of multiracial, old-school hoofers, who tear into Warren Carlyle\'s witty choreography...This new \'Kiss Me, Kate\' is a joy. It\'s simply one of the purest pleasures now on Broadway."" ', '""Cole Porter wrote one of the most glorious scores of all time and the songs are as vibrant as ever. The book by the Spewacks hasn’t weathered as well...Kelli O’Hara as the shrew is an absolute revelation...When you see a show being directed by Scott Ellis, you know you are in for a treat. He never disappoints and he always has new tricks up his sleeve. He is rhythmically complemented by the wonderful choreographer and each of his numbers are absolute eye-poppers.""

', '""O\'Hara can sing the phone book and I\'ll be entranced. Looking as lovely as ever, she does spellbinding things with a voice that moves from register to register as easily as eating ice cream...Will Chase makes a suitably fatuous but handsomely romantic lead, providing acting and singing talents that make the most of numbers like \'Where Is the Life that Late I Led?\'…Dancing wizard Corbin Bleu shows off his rat-a-tap-tap (even upside down!) and other terpsichorean skills."" ', '""A significant change in the tone of the piece by tweaking and cutting dialogue in the cause of eliminating what some perceive as inherent sexism within the show\'s backstage story...Kelli O\'Hara\'s glisteningly mature soprano and impeccable lyric phrasing...That\'s worth the price of admission alone...The rest of the show pretty much breezes along with terrific performances of classic material."" ', '""The authors’ take on marriage is more complex and insightful than we may recall. And where they did wander into material now rightly seen as toxic, a few changes and one major revision allow us to enjoy it in a new light...Carlyle’s often thrilling choreography offers a bountiful assortment...That too many other numbers disappoint is a problem not just with the choreography but also with the overall staging, which by the middle of the second act seems to run out of invention."" ', '""An effervescent throwback to the years when the musical theater was a reliable non-chemical antidepressant...O’Hara’s soprano ranks among the most beautiful I’ve ever heard on Broadway, and it finds a sterling vehicle...The standout among the supporting cast is unquestionably Styles, delivering a confident — no, make that smashing — Broadway debut...Although \'Kate\' moves at a frolicsome pace under Ellis’s direction, there’s no avoiding that the book loses steam in the second act."" ', '""In this production, the drama and fire are downplayed. O’Hara’s full and clear soprano is as beautiful as always, but her Lilli is more whimper than bang...Without such changes, however, \'Kiss Me, Kate\' might not be revivable at all—and that would be a shame, since the Roundabout’s production is often a delight. For one thing, it affords an opportunity to rehear Porter’s score. And whatever heat has been tamped down in the central couple flares up elsewhere in Scott Ellis’s staging."" ', '""Kelli O’Hara reaffirms her status as the reigning queen of the American musical with her wonderful performance...Scott Ellis once again shows a flair for directing a musical revival. The tweaks to Sam and Bella Spewack’s book may make it more palatable for today’s sensibility, but it remains old-fashioned and clunky even by 1948 standards. However, with its gorgeous score and a splendid production, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings of the book."" ', '""A musical that carries its own weight. It is a fully formed old fashioned extravaganza of a musical that sweeps you up into its arms and carries you off. Especially when the cast is lead by the gracious and skilled O’Hara. She opens her mouth and you swear you can hear the angels singing...Chase comes from behind and catches up to her at the finish line for a surprising and perfect conclusion.

Viewed through Sohne’s complicated book, it’s not only offbeat but also downbeat—but definitely not to its detriment...The singing—as well as the acting—is up to the standards set...Speciale creates a surreal atmosphere that lifts ‘The Boy Who Danced on Air’ into its own unique stratosphere. Along the way, he lifts the audience with him."" ', '""An unusual, profoundly affecting chamber musical...Creators Tim Rosser and Charlie Sohne amp up the drama in the second act, and push it further still in a coda. Their musical, optimally staged by Tony Speciale, taps into a universal source of pain and confusion: that phase of youthful innocence when, unable to fathom the adults who control us, we wishfully mistake them for gods."" ', '""This creation certainly soars through the air, while also stumbling at moments in its sincere treatment...There is one beautiful song after another...It’s quite an amazing casting score that this production found all of these wonderfully voiced men, who fit the characters\' descriptions so perfectly...The unneeded use of the politics and the Unknown Man add little to the heartbreaking story that already has been crafted with such care."" ', '""A provocative, thoughtful, and moving story...It is handled with sensitivity and delicate understanding…The band fully realizes some of the most gorgeous and original tunes heard in ages...Speciale\'s entire cast is comprised of skillful actors who make each part distinctly their own...Rosser and Sohne sanitized the depiction of bacha bazi...Still, I commend them for exposing the subject and bravely tackling such a complicated matter with earnest humanity and heart.""

', '""While the book gets a bit muddled, particularly in Act 2, I found myself moved by Paiman’s plight and interested in the moral complexity of the entire show. It’s refreshing to see a new musical grapple with multi-layered conflicts while exposing New York audiences to parts of the human experience we haven’t seen before. Another major highlight of the production is the gorgeous music...It also helps that the score is executed by such gifted singers."" ', '""Highly ambitious...It bravely attempts to delve into subject matter that is taboo and mine it for nuance and ambiguity while making a bold statement about the USA\'s contradictory behavior around the world...Valiantly conceived by composer Tim Rosser and book writer/lyricist Charlie Sohne, and keenly and exquisitely directed by Tony Speciale, the production beguiles, asking difficult questions and never providing pat answers. The results are mostly impressive."" ', '""In this deeply moving portrayal, exquisitely told through song, we are witness to intolerable crimes and brutality against these very young boys...This is not an easy production in which to be an audience and the fact that it is somewhat lightened by melodic music and good storytelling helps. But if you are squeamish in the face of bodily harm, beware!...Tony Speciale directs this cast with extraordinary understanding and tantalizing aplomb."" ', '""While the ugly practice of bacha bazi seems like a disturbing conceit for a musical, director Tony Speciale blends the offensiveness with inspiration and theatricality, and the cast sings with compelling power...The well-crafted production and gifted performers bring an intriguing, though certainly unsettling tradition to the stage with the actors\' layered sensitivity and the human strength of love and spirit. With some editing, this innovative musical has staying power.""

', '""An impressive feat of imagination, delving with remarkable sensitivity into a culture that might seem bizarre, even repugnant, to American audiences...Rosser and Sohne lay out the situation with clarity and without melodrama...The big issue in Speciale\'s production has to do with the casting of Paiman and Feda...The choice of older actors might be necessary, but it also adds a level of dishonesty to what is otherwise an admirably well-intentioned piece of work.""  ', '""The incredible cast are all wonderful in the roles they have been given...The entire cast have phenomenal vocals and strong acting abilities...Tony Speciale directs with sensitivity and some very clever tricks to showcase the age gap...The music is infectious and theatrical with threads of pop and Arabic ties blending nicely...As wonderful as this show is, and it has some amazing moments, musicals are now justifying things in society that may not have a right to be seen in such a bright light."" ', '""Most of Rosser’s songs are meandering, tuneless...Lyrics tend to be less specific and evocative without some structure. Well=researched and insightful phrases pepper even less successful efforts...Sohne’s book, however, is deft, illuminating, strong, and in the end carries one past musical weakness. Characters are credible and heady....Tony Speciale’s direction and Nejla Yatkin’s integrated choreography are inspired."" ', '""Uneven. The book is overworked. In addition to the two love stories, there\'s a distracting subplot...But Rosser\'s score nicely incorporates Afghan rhythms through the use of percussion and the lute-like rubab.

It may stumble a little, but that’s what happens when you leap forward.” ', ""“[A] dull, melodically uninteresting…score played offstage by a five-piece band…Speciale's earnest, physically agile production never convinces us we're not on W. 36th Street but in rural Afghanistan. Partly, this is because the dialogue and accents…sound so American…'The Boy Who Danced on Air' is to be applauded for dramatizing…bacha bazi in a way that finds tragic beauty in its victims. But provocative subject matter, even when sensitively presented, doesn't necessarily make great theatre.” "", '""Features some terrific solo dancing and stirring song duets...Offers much stunning visual appeal. Having seen the Frontline documentary, however, I was left with many questions...How much of the real story is sacrificed to hew to the conventions of American musical theater? Sohne and Rosser do not omit the ugliness, although the musical presents it discreetly...The effect is to make \'The Boy\' feel more like a homoerotic romantic musical than a sort of sober drama."" ', '“I admit to being riveted by the story while wishing that the production was a little better...Clearly, the story and the setting are unique and interesting and deserve to be told…Raviv brings Jahandar brilliantly to life on the stage in a nuanced and masterful performance. I just wish that they had spent a little more effort on the character of Paiman...What did work well however, was the music and lyrics..I think with some work, this could become an important piece of theater.” ', '“Despite the violence and troubling subject matter, the show has moments that are quite beautiful…While not great theater, the story has potential—although a side plot involving a power plant built by Americans is distracting…Despite the setbacks, director Tony Speciale manages to keep your attention…Raviv turns in a strong and steady performance…Rosser and Sohne took a risk, and they deserve credit for that—even if their hard work does not add up to a hit.” ', '""The ick factor here is dangerously high, a problem that the production labors hard to mitigate through aesthetics...It would be enough of an achievement to make this story palatable...But Mr. Rosser and Mr. Sohne were even more ambitious: They have two more stories to tell...Still, the music rewards the ear...What’s more, it is beautifully sung...To make a successful musical on this subject would require exquisite discretion, but discretion is exactly what the subject forbids."" ', '""This might have worked had Sohne’s book had a little more poetry in it, a bit more subtlety. But the dialogue and the emotions therein feel as though rendered with a trowel versus a paint brush...Sohne and Rossner’s songs have an authentic, idiomatic sound to them, and yet are rendered in a cozily familiar musical theater style...Iwata seems to be a young performer worth watching...The rest of the cast feels oddly stilted...Wish Sohne and Rossner could take another crack at the show."" ', ""“Initially intriguing but ultimately unsatisfying…Sohne’s earnest book has an abundance of stiff dialogue, repetitiveness, and a drawn-out, extraneous subplot…The show’s arresting aspects clash with the uneven book and score, and at two hours and 20 minutes, 'The Boy Who Danced on Air' is periodically dull...'The Boy Who Danced on Air' is billed as a fable, and those aesthetic qualities are imaginatively rendered. As an integrated musical, it stumbles in its form, and in presenting reality.” "", '""Spirited and nuanced, but lacks the caution, finesse, and heterogeneity needed to avoid joining the ranks of American musicals that have tried to absorb non-Western cultures, only to abuse and debase them...The actors perform with a liveliness befitting a much larger stage, even though each has been directed as though in his own world...No Afghans were harmed in the making of this play (at least not physically), but it doesn’t appear that many were consulted, either.""

All four performers in this almost entirely sung show are outstanding as they tell a simple, beautiful, and original story about how small acts and interactions can change lives. This sweet and quietly extraordinary musical is a must-see.” ', '“Engaging and unpretentious, the music by Gwon and performers are right in the pocket. However, the music eventually loses pace with the story, causing the charm to wear a little thin...Bashor takes stage with ease...She is an excellent singer...The other three singers are also clearly well trained...This show has so much going for it...Unfortunately, the music doesn’t quite keep up...Consistent and comfortable but not memorable.” ', '“Gwon’s ‘Ordinary Days’ presents a mélange of mayhem, tears, truth and humor...Reminiscent of the boy meets girl, falls in love old tale but much more relatable in this 21st Century intelligent compelling musical...The story songs are filled with humor, passion, joy, hope, sadness and fury and readily understandable in this vignette styled production, smartly directed...The ensemble is outstanding, the message not new but a reminder and wake up call of what’s really important.” ', ""“’Ordinary Days’ does a tremendous amount of telling. It's a sung-through musical, and the four characters spend a lot of time explaining themselves...And it all works really well. The songs are lovely and smart and sensitive, and Gwon even makes the sung-through-ness succeed, as his work genuinely sounds like people communicating...Gwon provides enough...to tie together the four characters and give us a satisfying whole. The four-person cast is wonderful.” "", ""“A musical theatre treat...’Ordinary Days’ focuses on just four New Yorkers...Bashor's performance is simply astonishing. The rest of the cast is also excellent...The dense lyrics reveal layered characters and move the story forward, while still remaining clever and unexpected...Though ‘Ordinary Days’ is not especially illuminating or revelatory, the production is solid and does justice to this little gem.” "", '""That the characters appear so utterly quotidian, on one hand and so familiar on the other, speaks to the play’s immeasurable charm...In a sung through musical, the voices tell the story, and the four actors in this production make that an especially affecting experience simply because they sound truthful and honest...It’s an understated, beautifully sung, and moving story about connecting with another person.""

The songs are nice, the acting is good and the story is interesting. It is all very engaging and seems to go by a lot quicker than the alleged 90 minute or so running time.” "", '""A sweet and thoughtful musical...Gwon’s score does serve the story well...These songs flesh out the characters into three-dimensional people...The show’s reliance on songs that explore character through metaphor rather than plot can cumulatively become a bit heavy-handed...The four actors bring these New Yorkers to life with both personality and heart...This production demonstrates that sometimes the most \'ordinary\' things can offer the greatest joys.” ', '""A sweet escape back to 2007.

Likable, brisk, and professionally mounted with a friendly and strong-singing cast, the Keen production of ‘Ordinary Days’ makes an enjoyably pleasant evening.

', '“Though it retains the premise of the original, it diverges smartly in both plot and milieu...Fontana gets just about everything right...Even though Horn’s book bristles with zingers, a lot of the humor is so rooted in story it doesn’t need words...Comedy rarely flows as smoothly as it does here. The secret is more than the book; it’s the songs...The staging and physical production of ‘Tootsie’ are so trite and vanilla...Happily, ‘Tootsie’ recovers, thanks in part to its excellent cast.” ', ""“’Tootsie’ is great for a laugh...Fontana, in the performance of his career to date, stars as Michael Dorsey...This is the rare musical in which the book outshines the score. At their best, Yazbek’s songs are densely wordy and nervy; elsewhere, they are merely agreeable, and sometimes a skosh underbaked. But ‘Tootsie' is packed with great zingers and character jokes, and director Ellis’s bright, snappy production has assembled a murderer’s row of actors to put them over.” "", '“Fontana was a very good choice...What Fontana does so well is to infuse his character with both comedy and heart. Still...Much of ‘Tootsie\'s’ strength comes from the performances by some great supporting players...There are a couple of clunky moments...The score generally seems functional, serving the plot without providing too many memorable moments...Notwithstanding these concerns, ‘Tootsie’ hits the mark on so many levels...An entertaining confection to enjoy.""

On the surface, it\'s a conventional musical...But it\'s unconventionally funny. And thanks to an A-list cast of comedians, it\'s the comedy that makes this one sing...Yazbek\'s score is still mighty clever and tuneful. His lyrics are a gas, and the inside theatre references are a terrific bonus...Humor is of course in the ear of the beholder and \'Tootsie\' may not tickle every funnybone, but judging by the laugh meter, this one\'s off the charts.” ', '“’Tootsie’ is full of terrific moments...Most important, a genuinely believable, winning performance by Fontana, who’s so darn convincing as Dorothy that when he starts to sing as Michael it simply sounds wrong...’Tootsie’ will always be a little old-fashioned, no matter how evolved Dorothy and her pals get. But in that famous sparkly red dress, she looks right at home on Broadway.” ', '“This ‘Tootsie’ is a delight, a not-quite-blind date that plays out so much better than you could have imagined...You’ll witness a team at the top of its game...Yazbek’s score is maybe a bit too heavy on the mid-tempo numbers...Best of all is Horn’s dialogue, loaded with sitcom zingers...There’s not a weak link in this cast, though the whole thing belongs to Fontana.”  ', '“A marvel of movie-to-musical reinvention. As much an update as it is an adaptation, the show acknowledges that gender politics have undergone significant changes...while embracing what makes this loony tale still so much fun today. But what really stands out is the wit. This ‘Tootsie’ yields more laughs per minute than any musical since ‘The Book of Mormon’...If ‘Tootsie’ has one major shortcoming, it’s not the relentless silliness but the erratic music.""

The music is serviceable and the lyrics quippy, but you won't be humming tunes on your way out of the theater.” "", '“The laugh-out-loud funniest musical of the Broadway season. Yes, it’s another tune-filled spin on a hit movie...But this one is actually good...Musical-comedy heaven...Leading a dynamite cast is Fontana in a give-him-the-Tony-now tour de force...Ellis stages this circus like a ringmaster supreme. The infectious score is by Yazbek...The uproarious book ups the fun quotient of the movie by creating an avalanche of one-liners that leave you laughing uncontrollably.” ', '“The book, by Horn, ranks among the flat-out funniest written for a new musical in the past decade...I haven’t laughed as much or as hard at a Broadway musical...The workmanlike score, by Yazbek, drains most of the fizz from the champagne...This is a particular pity because in addition to its outstanding book, ‘Tootsie’, directed with ample polish by Scott Ellis, features a terrific cast.” ', '“The songs are peppy, if not especially remarkable...Yazbek shows his gift for writing for character...A lot of Horn’s jokes are groaners, but some of them aren’t and the script is packed with so many that the laughs-per-minute ratio stays pretty high. The cast is a treat...There are so many things that ‘Tootsie’ does right, that it’s frustrating what it gets wrong. This is still a show in which women are the vehicle for male self-improvement...Still, ‘Tootsie’ is a giddy night out.” ', ""“Ellis’s staging is a graduate seminar in how to direct physical comedy so that every joke lands with a bang...The catch is that ’Tootsie' doesn’t need to be a musical...If you’ve never seen ‘Tootsie’, I expect you’ll enjoy the musical version. If you already know and love it, though, you’ll probably be laughing more at the movie you remember than the show you’re seeing on stage.” "", '“There really is much to like about ‘Tootsie’. Horn’s book is chock-a-block with digressive one-liners...The kinetic Yazbek score — jazzy, brassy and evocative of the ’80s in a gently satiric way — is also great fun, which is no slight...But ‘Tootsie’ struggles mightily to get past one problem...It needs to punish Michael for his ruse...And yet, the show well knows that everyone has come to see Dorothy Michaels...The show wants both to deconstruct \'Tootsie\', and snag its nostalgic fans."" ', '“Fontana’s performance is so magnetically assured that we can just about believe in Dorothy’s improbable success...Yazbek’s numbers have a chatty, cabaret-like feel to them that accommodates a range of vocal styles and blends well with Robert Horn’s book, which is full of salty one-liners. Horn’s efforts to add a topical feminist spin to the story are less compelling...’Tootsie’, which is set in the present day, might have dug deeper into current debates about gender identity.” ', '“The musical within the musical...really works, as many moments do throughout — but the cliché factor doesn’t exactly drop to zero...That said, the show is damn funny...The performances are worthy of raves...Ultimately, the show has the good-time vibe of a jukebox musical, trading long-loved hit tunes for clever zingers and humor. And it makes an honest effort to recognize and support the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, despite the plot’s inherent misalignment with them.” ', '“Horn supplies a few one-liners that are every bit as funny as the movie’s zingers...This ‘Tootsie’ is also blessed with the awesome Broadway musical debut of Andy Grotelueschen...The show’s problems center on Michael Dorsey, both in and out of his Dorothy Michaels persona...Dorothy is every bit as brazen as when he auditioned as a man...Oddly, \'Tootsie\' gives us a sneak peek at the coming cultural phenomenon, white female privilege.""

It’s exhausting— but you can’t say it isn’t fun."" ', '""\'On Your Feet!\' is every bit as propulsive as the music and the personalities it celebrates.

Even at its most shameless it\'s impossible to deny the production\'s generosity of spirit.""

There\'s just enough heartfelt emotion to draw us in.""

The Band's Visit,"['""One of the most ravishing musicals you will ever be seduced by...A Broadway rarity seldom found these days outside of the canon of Stephen Sondheim: an honest-to-God musical for grown-ups...Directed by David Cromer with an inspired inventiveness that never calls attention to itself, \'The Band’s Visit\' flows with the grave and joyful insistence of life itself...Close to perfect musically...A miraculous show."" ', '""This honey-and-spice-on-the-breeze musical is one of a kind...High among the myriad treasures of \'The Band’s Visit\' is the score, deceptively gentle but filled with yearning; and the unexpectedly vibrant performance of Katrina Lenk. Both elements continue to enchant and grow richer, even after repeated viewings...It is safe to say that Sasson gives an equally expert performance. What is perhaps unexpected is that his presence adds a new flavor to the piece."" ', '""It’s the best thing in town...Directed with an easy rhythm of his own by David Cromer and featuring a sublime score by the multi-talented composer-lyricist David Yazbeck, this is a show that manages with great subtlety and appealing versatility to cover a lot of musical ground, enhanced by a carefully written book by Itamar Moses...A work of low-key charm balanced by the high impact of intuitive ensemble work and a gorgeous score unlike anything on Broadway."" ', '""Sitting in the last row was just fine, which is a tribute both to the structure of the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and to David Cromer\'s quietly intense direction. \'The Band\'s Visit\' happens at a whisper, but it is a whisper that fills the theatre with emotion and beauty...It\'s a theatrical iceberg: 80% of its content is below the surface. The score is lovely, the lyrics by turns funny or moving or both. The performances are exactly right."" ', '""\'The Band\'s Visit\' activates emotions that we would normally avoid in order to push through the hectic tedium of each day...Classical Middle Eastern scales and American jazz seamlessly fuse to create a sophisticated new sound. Through lyrics that are both clever and sincere, Yazbek gorgeously conveys a highly uncommon Broadway love story...The most beautiful musical on Broadway, and the bravest.""  ', '""Absolutely and quietly devastating in its magnificence. It has a beauty to its sadness, and a sense of goodness and hope in its desire. Not much has changed with this perfectly constructed piece...\'The Band’s Visit\' has become more solid and in some way, sits more squarely and securely on stage...The cast is exceptional...What stood out for me on this visit to Bet Haatikva is the slow build of sadness and longing that settles on every surface in town."" ', '""Sasson is, not surprisingly, effective in the Tewfik role...For all intents, Gabay (billed as Gabai in the film credits) is repeating his award-winning performance. Though his characterization differs from Shalhoub’s, it doesn’t alter to the least degree the perfect chamber musical that \'The Band’s Visit\' was when it bowed at the Atlantic Theater and then moved uptown to the Barrymore Theatre. It’s perfect in every department.""

Scenes blend effortlessly into songs. The staging’s both utterly theatrical and finely realistic...This bittersweet heartbreaker might be the best we’ll see all year.” ', '""The best musical of the year...Directed with supreme finesse by Cromer and performed by the best cast imaginable, this small-scale show is fine enough to fill you with fresh hope for a genre that has lately been running on fumes...Part of what makes \'The Band’s Visit\' so special is that it steers clear of the obvious...Moses has translated the screenplay of \'The Band’s Visit\' into musical-comedy terms with quiet skill...This fairy tale is one in which it is pure happiness to believe.""  ', '""Feed your soul: Go see \'The Band’s Visit\'...Has stayed with me in the year since it opened off-Broadway, like a dream from which I never wanted to awaken...David Cromer’s production and an incomparable ensemble could not be bettered...Each character is carefully fleshed out over the course of the show’s single act...\'The Band’s Visit\' flows as if in a seamless, tidal movement, like an ode."" ', '""Beautiful music, beautiful story, beautiful acting...One of the many marvels of \'The Band’s Visit\' — which is directed with a maestro’s virtuosic vision by David Cromer — is that its composer, David Yazbek, and book writer, Itamar Moses, wring so much personality and melodic soulfulness out of a story about going nowhere...Like other cast standouts, Lenk and Shalhoub have managed to metabolize these characters in ways you don’t ordinarily get to experience in a Broadway musical."" ', '""Cromer has maintained the show’s thrilling intimacy, exploring the meanderings of the human heart...Furthermore, it’s a story that Yazbek’s glorious score, overflowing with rhapsodic melody, mostly set against pulsating middle Eastern rhythms, lifts to a breathtakingly elevated plane...The passing of time has only deepened the masterful performances...One of the show’s triumphs is the authenticity and responsiveness of the entire company."" ', '“’The Band’s Visit’ lives happily without all the usual tawdry tricks beloved by standard-issue Broadway musicals...Nothing that happens in ‘The Band’s Visit’ is ‘very important.’ It’s just all wonderful — heartwarming, heartbreaking, heart-confusing, and mind-stimulating...We get floods of charm, empathy, and human understanding, thanks to Moses’s script, Yazbek’s songs, and Cromer’s stunningly discreet, daringly austere production.” ', '“Extraordinary...Moses’ economical book and especially Yazbek’s seductive score delve deep into and celebrate the human condition...Director David Cromer has outdone himself here. The sensitivity with which he treats each character and their respective plights, as well as the patience of his storytelling, is nothing short of miraculous...The cast is absolutely divine...Their ensemble work and music-making make the show.” ', '“With quiet lyricism and achingly beautiful humanity, ‘The Band’s Visit’ works its way into your heart and leaves you surprised that you could be so profoundly moved by such a simple tale...The company is uniformly outstanding...A wonderful, understated, and mature show that gets its impact not from spectacle but from the specificity with which it charts a journey of the heart. The band in question may have ended up in the wrong place, but as theater this is a perfect destination.” ', ""“I was thoroughly touched, amused, and impressed…Musical theatre fans shouldn't expect a show with all the familiar Broadway ingredients…The songs are so well-integrated with the book that they arise organically from the dialogue and situations…Shalhoub…uses his mellifluous voice and delicate gestures to create a man of assured integrity and grace…Lenk is enthralling, her sinewy slenderness and feline features combining with a…lived-in sensibility to create a vibrantly compelling persona.” "", '""The same widely acclaimed show plus better acoustics, and better accents...On a second viewing, the musical feels terribly sad, but a beautiful, pleasurable sad, like a song that you can’t stop listening to...This is a Broadway musical unafraid to be different...The tensions between Arabs and Israelis are acknowledged in an understated way, delivering no artificial happiness but suggesting reasons to be hopeful."" ', '""While I feel lucky to have first experienced it in a more intimate setting, I\'m happy to report that \'The Band\'s Visit\' on Broadway is still a charmer...Has remained true to the plot and tone of its source but is nevertheless totally fresh and different...The movie\'s sensitive \'indie\' feel has survived...Without trying to be foot-tapping, sing-in-the-shower ear candy Yazbek\'s score is nevertheless addictively haunting."" ', '""Like a mirage, it shimmers. But better. Because this hushed, heart-melting musical is real — and truly magical...The show is a quiet musical meditation that casts a spell through its songs, alluring ambience, and excellent actors...The book packs warmth, wit, and economy. Irresistible songs blend strains of Arabic and Israeli melodies and flecks of jazz...One resists gushing about a musical that works so wonderfully because it never overstates. It doesn\'t belt. It whispers."" ', '""Modest, mild-mannered but utterly absorbing musical...The integration of David Cromer’s intimate and sensitive direction; David Yazbek’s Middle-Eastern flavored score; and Itamar Moses’ book is so seamless that it is virtually impossible to pick apart...May lack the epic excitement and intensity of something like \'Hamilton\' or \'Dear Evan Hansen,\' but I doubt that a better written new musical will come to Broadway this season."" ', '""Yazbek chooses to seduce with music and lyrics that slyly slip into our consciousness through an inspired repetition, with melodies unfolding to make the spirit both ache and soar...Yazbek’s score is perfectly married to Itamar Moses’s lovely book...Cromer doesn’t find the humor in zingers or one-liners but rather in the quirks of characters and places...Yazbek performs marvelous variations to make us hear the music fresh, and in the process almost reinvents the Broadway musical."" ', '""A special theater treat awaits you...Yazbek’s poignant music and lyrics are so very expressive...The charm of the show follows the odd interaction, especially between Dina and Tewfiq, and all is presented with sensitive understatement. This is a musical that gets under the skin...The step by step getting to know one another that the musical depicts becomes a statement illustrated by the show’s overall magical quality."" ', '""It transfers to Broadway with its delicate alchemy intact, borne aloft by the intoxicating Middle-Eastern rhythms of David Yazbek\'s original score and by the soulful performances of an exemplary ensemble...None of the hushed intimacy, the subtlety or nuance of this narratively spare piece has been lost...The entire ensemble is attuned to the show\'s quiet observations, and its unusual, funny-sad sensibility."" ', '“This gem of a musical, whose fine book buoys grounded lyrics, embraces what we have in common...That it does so with limpid delicacy eschewing Hollywood outcomes makes the piece as refreshing as it is sympathetic...A wonderful experience...Yazbeck’s infectious music embraces Middle Eastern influences with estimable skill, maintaining an atmosphere of \'other\'...There isn’t a single weak link in acting or vocals."" ', '""Cromer, Moses, and Yazbek are clearly unified in their pursuit of the specific and the humane over the grandiose...A play of deep integrity — funny, generous, sweet without sentimentality, poignant without melodrama, and emotionally expansive even as it insists upon its own smallness...\'The Band’s Visit\' is quietly modeling real theatrical and musical courage. Its sound—dense and atmospheric and drawn from a non-Western musical idiom—is utterly distinctive on Broadway.""

Finian's Rainbow,"['“This 1947 hit is guilty of occasional silliness and simplistic racial politics (once considered radically progressive). Nonetheless, it never stops pleasing as a tuneful, socially conscious, romantic fantasy laced with moonbeams, a leprechaun, rainbows, and a crock of gold...the cast consistently delivers with affecting conviction and charm, led by the marvelous Melissa Errico, bringing beauty, assurance, happiness, and a gorgeous voice to her every moment.” ', ""“The Irish Repertory Theatre revival of ‘Finian's Rainbow’ proves that it gets better with age. This social comment story wedded to Irish blarney remains a delightful musical comedy with a message, one about the evils of racism, a very timely topic which never seems to get old. Led by the charming Melissa Errico and the stalwart Ryan Silverman, Charlotte Moore's production with a cast of 13 is a marvel of economy, though you never feel that it is a small offering.” "", '""\'Finian’s Rainbow\' has a score and a message that is perfect for today’s wounded hearts. The revival at the Irish Rep will put some of that spring back into your step and give you hope...With a book by  \'Yip\' Harburg and Fred Saidy that normally stalls, director Charlotte Moore has adapted the show for a hipper, more music-driven show, which is incandescently lyrical. The cast all posses gorgeous instruments.""  ', '""It\'s a revival that\'s handsomely spruced up and well appointed with talent to fit their smartly renovated twenty-second street theater...Still an intimate production but with richer staging and some fine tuning...The golden-voiced, very pretty Melissa Errico is not too old to play the romantic lead, and her voice is as golden as ever...The ensemble features some terrific belters...My wish for all of you reading this is that you\'ll find time to see this grand old musical fairy tale."" ', '""Moore captures the magic within Burton Lane, Yip Harburg, and Fred Saidy\'s 1947 classic with great immediacy...A scrappy affair that captures the heart and soul of the material without going over the top...Best of all, the compactness of this production allows the company to perform the matchless score unamplified...With Errico, Silverman, Grovey, and company front and center, sounding like a cast of 50 rather than 13, this \'Finian\'s Rainbow\' is downright glorious."" ', '""So delightful that the run of the show has already been extended...Moore requested and received permission to drastically revise the show...All that’s left is its bare bones. This puts the score right where it belongs, at center stage, and it does so without destroying the dramatic continuity that’s needed to make the show cohere....You won’t hear better singing—or better songs—on any New York stage...All of the songs in the show make the strongest possible impression."" ', '""Ms. Errico is, if anything, even more persuasive as Sharon, an Irish lass newly arrived on American soil, than when I saw her in the role a dozen years ago...The score, by Burton Lane and E. Y. Harburg, is one of the most enduringly delicious ever concocted for an American musical. The book, by Mr. Harburg and Fred Saidy, is more perishable, a mix of high whimsy and topical satire...Ms. Moore has come up with a very companionable interpretation."" ', '""A four-piece orchestra and a 13-member cast led by the glorious Melissa Errico do delicious justice to the show’s terrific tuneful melodies...Given the music, we should be grateful that Irish Rep artistic director Charlotte Moore was willing (as both director and adapter) to wrestle with a book, by Harburg and Fred Saidy, that could hardly be more problematic or unwieldy...What’s most memorable are the melodies."" ', '""A joyous, colorful revival...Watching Charlotte Moore\'s small-scale (13-actor) but big-hearted spin on this work, it\'s hard to care too much about the babblings of any nattering naysayers. This is, admittedly, mostly thanks to the score, which ranks as one of the very best ever composed for a Broadway musical...Its underlying story...is pretty hefty stuff...Traditional tropes are at play, of course...It still works when treated as honestly and forthrightly as Moore does here."" ', '""The show’s book has been substantially cut, but its satire and political commentary remain intact. That said, I do think some of it’s all been laid on just a tad too thick...Still, it’s the stunning score you’ll most take notice of here...Choreographer Barry McNabb uses the small stage well to allow some lovely dancing interludes (including a sweet solo for Woodruff), while the four-piece orchestra adds depth to Josh Clayton’s orchestrations."" ', '""The inherent glint-in-the-eye charm of \'Finian\' is simply but solidly captured by the folks, onstage and offstage, at the Irish Rep...Even with a good deal of trimming, the message comes through...Errico gives the friendly and melodic leading lady performance you would expect from her. Silverman is perfectly cast as Woody; while Evans makes a strong local debut and knocks the show cold with his \'When I’m Not Near the Girl I Love\'...This pint-size \'Finian\' scores on many levels."" ', '""\'Finian’s Rainbow\' still speaks to us, mostly through its terrific, socially conscious songs, as well as its lovely romantic ones...As well as delight in the glowing performance of Errico, one can sit back and enjoy the achievements of Ken Jennings as her father, the feisty Finian...The supporting cast members...are also superb...The small-scale production provides an intimacy that enables the key aspects of the musical, as adapted and directed by Moore, to shine through."" ', '""Plotwise, it\'s sentimental blarney...The glorious songs—which make up most of the two-hour run time thanks to director Charlotte Moore\'s judicious book cuts—should win you over...The 13, un-amplfied cast members are in superb voice throughout...There\'s no denying that this is a modest mounting due to the company\'s budget and small stage...And yet, this seems to be the ideal way to experience \'Finian\'s\' ample charms."" ', '""If the trimmed book seems rather incoherent now, the glorious score, sung so beautifully here, more than makes up for any narrative shortcomings...While Harburg and Fred Saidy’s book deserves praise for its combination of whimsy and a socially responsible message, it’s also pretty convoluted. That likely explains why director Moore focused her attentions on the music...Each number is a thoroughly crafted gem...And the company, cast for their sublime voices, sing their hearts out."" ', '""A delicious and delightful antidote to the harsh realities we’ve been suffering. And what better way to provide social commentary than in satire and glorious song...Director Moore has adapted the book, avoiding any datedness and updating the book to a more fable-like approach – without losing the bite. Moore also keeps the pace moving briskly, wisely utilizing every inch of the stage, giving the production a rewarding fulsomeness...The score is a pot of gold that needs no burying."" ', '""The luminous and ageless Melissa Errico turns in a lustrous and lusty performance in this enchanting, trimmed-down, revival production of the timeless classic ‘Finian’s Rainbow.’ Staged in the intimate space of Irish Rep, the two-hour musical projects a warmth and intimacy well-suited to the charms of the romantic fable…The lush score has many song beauties…Errico and Silverman are well-matched, both in looks and voice, and have some truly lovely duets."" ', '""\'Finian\'s Rainbow\' is chockablock with sweet, near to saccharine songs that we all know from grandparents or a dusky bar…But what this reviewer didn\'t know was that the script was also tackling Jim Crow segregation, racism, and the hope necessary to conquer it. Therefore this is the perfect piece to see post the election of a man who espoused a return to a time that this piece is cautioning and arguing against."" ', '""Even in Irish Rep’s less-than-perfect rendering, the material resonates as it hasn’t in years. Alas, \'Finian’s Rainbow\' is relevant again...It’s one of the most left-leaning classic musicals around, and seeing it, you can understand why Harburg was blacklisted not long after. In Irish Rep’s staging, though, some of the book goes missing, and the political arguments are somewhat devitalized...Luckily, it’s one of the great scores...\'Finian\'s Rainbow\' once again speaks directly and eloquently."" ', '""The score features an unequaled collection of absolutely sterling songs, each one more melodic and appealing than the previous one…The show’s book is another story...The libretto plods along from scene to scene, without any apparent forward motor to the plot…Director Moore and choreographer Barry McNabb make the most of the tiny stage, and the results are sometimes quite lively…Most of the featured performers seem to have been born to sing these songs."" ', '""Each time the band strikes up at the Irish Rep, you can be sure something delightful is in store. The cast Moore has assembled is one of the most vocally gifted in town, led by Melissa Errico...Moore has cut the book to the bone...It\'s a dangerous, if audience-pleasing, approach; a show that originally barely made sense now borders on the incoherent...Moore hasn\'t really solved the problem of what to do with this infectious, often delightful, sometimes maddening show."" ', '""Songs are still swell, though somewhat thinner due to a small cast, the two attitudes/subjects remain strange bedfellows, and the piece has been so condensed that its romance proceeds with enough speed to give you whiplash...To my mind, the find of the evening is Lyrica Woodruff  (Susan the Silent). The performer is utterly captivating...Director Charlotte Moore has a painterly feel for creating pictures, whether still or moving."" ', '""\'Finian’s Rainbow\' is as relevant and \'groundbreaking\' as it was in 1947...Burton Lane’s music is sumptuous and is the star of this Irish Rep production...The ensemble cast is outstanding and supports the principal actors with sheer perfection...Despite the overall stellar performances, this production of \'Finian’s Rainbow\' falls flat and it is not easy to determine why...Perhaps this matrix of lackluster creative team support affected the entire performance?"" ', '""Moore has fashioned a fleet, intimate (if occasionally disjointed) 2-hour version of the show, and the cast is charming. The star is Errico, who has a gorgeous voice and who previously partnered with Silverman in \'Passion.\' They sing wonderfully, but the pairing is not as felicitous here...They struck me as mismatched and unsparked. I also wish Moore had deployed her fine actors with a little more attention to one another...Look at one another! You’re adorable!"" ', '""There\'s a hokiness about \'Finian\'s Rainbow\' that has never sat right with me and in many ways, the Irish Rep\'s stripped-down version struck me as little more diverting than an average high school production. The Rep\'s revival has condensed the plot, making the story even more difficult to follow than it originally was…The entire cast works hard but while they all have great voices, they\'re a mixed bag when it comes to acting."" ', '""The plot is convoluted and doesn’t bear close scrutiny by today’s standards...It doesn\'t hold up. Seventy years later I squirmed in my seat...There is no chemistry between Ryan Silverman and Melissa Errico, and they both seem to be phoning it in...It doesn’t help that Moore’s laissez-faire directing allows the actors to practically ignore each other during their love scenes.

The New Yorkers,"['“Rando’s direction cunningly keeps a sense of giddy intoxication bubbling through the proceedings…The scintillating Porter songs, played with masterful appreciation by the 29-piece orchestra, are the production’s raison d’être. The script ties them together in fanciful, if sometimes inane, fashion, and it’s also heavily peppered with scattershot jokes. Many of them land, some of them don’t. But when they don’t, it’s no calamity. The performers move happily on, taking the audience with them.” ', '“The highly talented cast of 31 players acts, sings, and dances through an effervescent tale…‘The New Yorkers’ is hilarious, extremely clever, and filled with spectacular wordplay and some of the most sparkling lyrics in recent memory…The 30-piece Encores! orchestra beautifully performs Porter’s sophisticated melodies and lush, new arrangements…This is a splashy entertainment for fans of musical comedy and the Great American Songbook."" ', '""Directed by John Rando, with a choice cast of singing shtick artists, \'The New Yorkers\' makes the most puerile silliness seem deeply sophisticated and high sophistication look sublimely silly...This blithe and boozy production is a product of painstaking theater archaeology...Porter’s impeccable tongue-twisting lyrics have been mastered with style by all involved.""

The new \'The New Yorkers\' is just as delightfully flimsy and nonsensical as the original surely was.""

', '""Smartly, the right ingredients for a crowd-pleasing theatrical entertainment have been mixed here: Sara Bareilles’ catchy pop-theatrical score, Diane Paulus’ steady and relatively unshowy direction, and a first-rate cast led by the finest ingredient of them all: the amazing Jessie Mueller...Every conflict in Jenna’s life feels entirely real in Mueller’s expert hands...I suspect some viewers will be coming back for seconds."" ', '""It’s easy as pie to fall for \'Waitress\'...Deliciousness is on the menu...Mueller’s performance is nicely balanced...Mueller’s also a perfect fit for Bareilles’s alternately sorrowful and empowering songs...\'Waitress\' does a swell job illustrating the shades of gray in human relationships..Jessie Nelson’s book is sharp. \'Waitress\' is more than capably directed by Diane Paulus. The pie is ready. Leave room for second helpings."" ', '""It is propelled by a performance of open-hearted generosity and raw, tangible emotion by Mueller...Best of all, singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, making her theatrical debut, supplies a set of songs that have her own distinctive twang of country-inflected pop yet also pulse with feeling. They contain a bracing edge that commands rapt, enraptured attention, while director Diane Paulus keeps things emotionally engaging, witty and lingeringly, achingly human."" ', '""From score to casting, book to staging, everything comes together with a deceiving ease. Jessie Mueller is the heart and soul of the show as Jenna. No wonder she takes so easily to Bareilles’ score: The songwriter’s piano-driven style combines storytelling and catchy melodies...The show is also better than the movie in how it creates a tightknit, affectionate community onstage."" ', '""The positives far outnumber the negatives...The score is a beaut. Bareilles covers the territory with ballads, beautiful choral numbers, big dance numbers and Jenna’s killer anthems. The cast is pleasingly diverse without shouting about it...\'Waitress\' is a feel-good show that’s no mere guilty pleasure. It’s got soul and heart, sweetness and crust all in fine measure."" ', '""Echoing a weakness in the original screen source, Paulus and Latarro could be criticized for overplaying the whimsy. But the material is anchored at every step by Bareilles\' melodious pop score and Mueller\'s supremely natural performance as Jenna...The ballads are not Broadway-style songs in that they advance the plot, but they do something just as vital, which is to deepen our affection for the characters and our access to their inner lives."" ', '""It is the warmth of the ensemble, the intimate harmonics of Sara Bareilles\' music, the fluid fusion of Diane Paulus\' staging and, above all, the flaky layers of vulnerability exposed by the show\'s golden star, Jessie Mueller, that matter most...Mueller\'s is a performance stripped of condescension, lived in the moment and rich in musical pleasures...Paulus and Latarro know when to use their ensemble and when to keep it in the booths and leave the stage to Mueller."" ', '""Simple ingredients can produce scrumptious, and healing, results. That\'s certainly the case with this delightful adaptation...The libretto retains the warm, gutsy spirit and earthy wit that marked the original screenplay, while Sara Bareilles provides a folk-based score that shimmers and charms, never straining too hard for theatricality…Jenna is also another showcase for the gentle pluck and vulnerability Mueller has brought to various roles."" ', '“The musical manages to be both bittersweet and joyful...Bareilles makes an impressive Broadway debut. Her music and lyrics illustrate the complexities of these women and their relationships...I struggled with some of Diane Paulus’s directorial choices...Sloppy choreography and direction distracts...Ultimately the music, lyrics and performances are so rich that these nits are minor distractions in an otherwise engaging show.” ', '""A divine Broadway chick flick with something for everyone to enjoy. Broadway darling Jessie Mueller (Jenna) tackles the downtrodden role with gusto and aplomb, bringing life to Ms. Bareilles\' music. But what may be more important is that the supporting cast brings life to the show itself…A perfect blend of soulful music, funny dialogue and a quirky cast of characters forms the basis for quite an enjoyable evening."" ', '""A great recipe: Take terrific songs by Bareilles, mix them to a story by Nelson that isn\'t too sugary, bake that with intimate, understated direction by Paulus and top it off with a powerhouse performance by Mueller...Nelson\'s script sometimes drifts toward icky sweetness but always seems to quickly cut it with a dash of vinegar...If you\'re hungry for a heartfelt gooey musical with a molten star in the middle, order up a slice of \'Waitress\'."" ', '""There\'s a palpable sense of community among the women, which is different from what you typically see on stage and screen...There\'s a lot going on, but none of it feels rushed or cramped or overwhelming. Ideas—good and bad—are given time to develop and flourish in pop singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles\'s score...\'Waitress\' is groundbreaking in that it is the first musical on Broadway with an all-female creative team...Order up!"" ', '""Admittedly, the comic coincidences and plot conveniences don\'t stand the test of realism and the ending is sentimental in a non-rom-com way. But the show\'s heart is earned through the beauty and integrity of Mueller\'s work...\'Waitress\' wears its flaws on its uniform sleeve, but the naked honesty of Mueller\'s singing is enough to make an overscheduled theater critic wish that the curtain would never come down."" ', '""\'Waitress\' is a sweet slice of a show that shines with the help of a star ingredient: Tony winner Jessie Mueller...Bareilles has crafted an upbeat, tuneful score that sounds akin to the pop sounds she’s known for with layered harmonies and ballads alongside lively numbers...\'Waitress\' is warm and endearing, but, like Jenna, it yearns to go somewhere it can’t quite get to. Luckily, the sweetest moments are filling enough."" ', '""There are so many things this show does well, but more than anything, there was an element of realness that proved a beautiful contrast to the make-believe and magic that is inherently theatre...There’s a lot of Broadway convention in this show, and some of that is unavoidable, but I was rarely bothered...There’s so much to love in this show. Not only is \'Waitress\' worth the wait, it’s also worth standing up for."" ', '""There are good reasons to savor \'Waitress,\' the sweet and tart new musical confection about love and pie, deliciously performed...Diane Paulus directs with her usual verve, but, in keeping with the material, more down-home and laid-back than usual...Bareilles has written a score full of pleasing songs...The lyrics won’t make Sondheim jealous; the plot is both implausible and yet fairly predictable. But what \'Waitress\' leaves us with is the affection evident among the characters."" ', '""It’s a tall order to combine romantic comedy with troubling depictions of spousal abuse...Nevertheless, the characters are authentic and surprising, and it ends with a heartwarming climax...Bareilles’ country-flavored, cute and quirky, introspective songs are nicely integrated into Jessie Nelson’s book...A few questionable choices stick out, like putting the band prominently onstage on a moving platform...Mueller looks browbeaten most of the time, but she has a warm aura and a stunning voice.""

Goldstein,"['""With the rhythm of Neil Simon and the fierceness of Philip Roth, Shulman’s solidly constructed and inventive book renders this archetypical premise with an abundance of humor, sentiment, and suspense.

Owen is eminently likable as the narrator, a man facing his own personal issues, while McGinnis proves once again that she has a magical voice.""

Its family is rather ordinary and its great romantic secret rings the bell of predictability…It takes some time to become invested in the characters, whose situations and behavior border on the clichéd and whose humor is generally as flat as a matzo.

With such a talented cast he could benefit from adding a few show-stopping numbers that really bring the house down."" ', '""There\'s rich material here, but Charlie Schulman\'s book is too sketchy and Michael Roberts\' songs rely on basic melodies and even more basic rhymes. To be fair, there\'s an eleventh-hour plot twist that nobody in the audience at my performance -- me included -- saw coming...If the director, Brad Rouse, can\'t make anything urgent or compelling out of these family stories, his cast is reasonably solid...But this complex saga is too cursorily treated to really come to life.""

Wild Abandon,"['""Diverting, gently comic, but dramatically slender…For all its underlying seriousness, \'Wild Abandon\' takes a lighthearted view of its heroine\'s familial and romantic travails. It generates occasional laughter, but not enough to make comedy its strong suit. The universality of its fact and fiction mixture of Leenya and Lynn\'s mother-daughter story will resonate with some, but there\'s little in the writing that\'s anywhere near as noteworthy as the multitasking talents of Leenya Rideout."" ', '""Leenya, a consummate actress, was born with talent far beyond the usual, excelling at everything – singing, playing piano and morphing into string instruments – violin, guitar, bass – all of which she showcases in this 90 minute presentation...She frequently takes on the role of her mother switching gears instantaneously, a tribute to her dramatic skills, as her complicated life emerges producing a release for a better, closer understanding between mother and daughter."" ', '“A unique lens into a complex mother-daughter relationship...A rich tapestry of narrative, over a dozen songs...’Wild Abandon’ is at its best when it skirts and states the thorny issues that arose between Lynn and Leenya as they struggled to understand each other\'s separate lives and goals...\'Wild Abandon\' ultimately reveals that this mother-and-daughter duo, however different in temperament, share a passion for art and have lived, and continue to live, outside the lines.""

Perhaps these twin goals converge a bit too neatly, especially given the harrowingly true complications Leenya introduces along the way, but there are so many hard-earned and poignant insights."" ', '“This is yet another play about breaking into, and surviving in, show business as combined with the story of a checkered daughter-mother relationship. Anyone’s reaction to it will rely on tolerance for hearing about someone else gab on about show-biz perils and how they have or haven’t been incorporated into an overall rewarding life...Under Rothe’s direction, Rideout does sufficiently well at the challenge. There are, though, one or two instances...where she risks dipping into the vulgar.” ', '“The concept of ‘Wild Abandon’ is clear: work through the tension of the past to better understand the present...The problem is that it\'s not until these final moments that the audience sees Lynn for who she really is...Slick tricks and musical virtuosity aren\'t enough for a show built around the baring of souls, though.

Its themes are important and life-affirming…The cast, under Walter Bobbie’s careful direction is uniformly magnificent…\'Bright Star\' is not perfect–some of the story seems contrived and sometimes predictable–but director Walter Bobbie keeps the musical moving forward with an intensity and freshness that is remarkable and noteworthy."" ', '""The lively hootenanny, hand- and thigh-slapping choreography is accomplished by the talents of Josh Rhodes, while director Walter Bobbie makes magic in moving this large cast around seamlessly…\'Bright Star\' has a down-home warmth that draws the audience into its glow, making the 2 hours, 30 minutes more than entertaining.""

', '""The songs are lush and catchy, the performers are spot-on. The show has a real star in Cusack...The songs are strong given Martin’s banjo interests of the last 40 years and Brickell’s ability to write hooks. Plus Steve has taken the sometimes on-the-nose story and peppered it with enough humor to lighten the gloom that threatens to overcome the proceedings like a storm cloud but never does...A lot of the songs in \'Bright Star\' are eminently hummable and should be covered by real country stars."" ', '""The show moves quickly under the creative direction of Walter Bobbie. The lead is Carmen Cusack, who provides us with a charismatic and energetic performance…The plot is quirky and uneven, but stays with the theme that love triumphs. The sweet bluegrass music is a treat, particularly for those who are unfamiliar with this delightful musical form. The music adds a nostalgic charm and melody to the show which is memorable.""

The set is unfussy but suits the story well...But it’s Martin and Brickell’s music that’s the brightest star in \'Bright Star\'. The bluegrass sounds complement the show’s setting and era, Americana music with layered harmonies and beautiful use of banjo and fiddle. Not every song is a winner, but there are stirring ballads and toe-tapping numbers throughout that audience members will enjoy.""

', '“\'Bright Star\' is a total anomaly. It’s wholly original and unashamedly sentimental and romantic, with a country-folk score and no well-known actors in the cast...The storytelling can be jumbled, improbable and sappy, and the characters are undeveloped. Nevertheless, it is a heartwarming and crowd-pleasing musical, sporting many pleasant country songs, a sunny disposition and a Southern Gothic flavor.""

', '""I found their story engrossing, entertaining, and very moving...The music is lively, but the fiddle and the banjo can only go so far to interestingly cover some twenty songs...I thought the melodies embellished the story more than the lyrics did, but the story itself, though somewhat predictable, is neatly told and very well crafted…There isn’t a lemon in this boatload of performing talent...Walter Bobbie has blended them all together into a refreshing smoothie of a musical."" ', '""Country hokum gets some slick packaging with \'Bright Star\'...The plot veers back and forth between the two eras, sometimes intertwining them, buoyed by the lilting country and bluegrass influenced score (which only bogs down in melodramatic moments) and fluid direction...It’s nicely pulled off though the characters and plot sometimes come off a little mushy, as if out of a Hallmark movie.""

The back story doesn’t unfold enough for the audience to feel like we understand what has actually gone on, and the character of Arthur is not fully developed...However, even though ‘Midnight at the Never Get’ may not succeed entirely as a theater piece, it is actually a successful musical evening due not only to Sonnenblick’s marvelous music, but to Bolen and Cohen’s talents as performers.” ', '""\'Midnight\' has the slightly over-slick feeling of a show that’s been through the workshopping process, and through it and through it. But the high gloss suits the subject matter...The show is solidly constructed and well performed by both Bolen and Cohen—and its last number comes with a particularly touching twist—but it’s difficult for Friedman to find his way in the finale. The show both wants to break itself and doesn’t.""   ', '""The emotionally rich but melodically not-quite-there songs are the results of Sonnenblick\'s attempt to capture the American songbook quality associated with the…compositions of Cole Porter and his ilk…Generally speaking, the lyrics and music, while superficially pleasant, and definitely well performed, sound like so-so pastiches of 40s and 50s numbers,…but too often falling short…Bolen\'s Trevor is personable, energetic, and expressive...Cohen offers a nice counterbalance."" ', '""Starts feeling less and less like a realistic look at a relationship, or the era, and more like a gay version of a 1940s melodrama. The songs go back in time as well, feeling like pastiches of, yes, Cole Porter...If the show would have been better off presented in an actual cabaret rather than a proscenium theater, and if one must have a high threshold for bathos to embrace (or even tolerate?) the ending, there are moments that are downright inspiring."" ', '""A charming if uneventful cabaret-style musical...Bolen narrates the story with remarkable stamina and a honeyed voice. Though for the better part of this 90-minute show, being in love seems to be his character’s only trait — until losing that love takes over...It may have been easier to feel sympathy for these fellas if they had more skin in the game...At its most profound, Sonnenblick’s musical explores the penumbras suggested by its title.""

Well, Sonnenblick is no slouch at dialogue...You just wish Sonnenblick had devoted as much care to character development and storytelling as he did to music and lyrics."" ', '""Mr. Sonnenblick’s musical compositions are indeed a fine representation of the era and The Great American Songbook, along with lyrics that are smart, sometimes witty, and turn sentimental during some sultry ballads.

Tyne Daly took the lead role of Countess Aurelia, and she was nothing short of magical...It is full of romance and humor and some excellent songs from Jerry Herman...The trio sung by the three madwomen is as much fun as anything you\'ll see on a stage, and Daly, Alison Fraser, and Ann Harada nailed it. The rest of the cast was also excellent, with some gorgeous, gorgeous voices.""

Its best quality is charm, and the cast in the Mufti production handily conveys that aspect of the work as it progresses...Alison Fraser is a hoot as Madame Constance, the Madwoman of the Market, and Ann Harada is amusing as the Madwoman of Montmarte.""

McGovern and Tucci provide splendid arrangements and musicianship...Not one of Jerry Herman’s best efforts, but still rather charming in its entirety.""

Nonetheless, the concept provides a platform for some wonderfully witty songs and for some outrageously hilarious portrayals...Although \'Dear World\' has a worthwhile message and some wonderfully entertaining moments, I can understand why it never won more positive attention. Still, I’m happy that the York brought \'Dear World\' to the stage.""

All inhabit their characters with impeccable comic timing and have vocal chops that do full justice to the ear-hugging songs and witty rhymed lyrics...Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who found \'Measure for Measure\' to be the \'single exception to the delightfulness of Shakespeare\'s plays\' would certainly find plenty to be delighted with in \'Desperate Measures.\'"" ', '""Delightful, slightly bawdy show…The entire cast are excellent…The music by David Friedman is consistently hummable and occasionally more than that.

', '""In addition to the cast\'s sterling performances under Bill Castellino\'s simple yet lively direction, and James Morgan\'s easy moveable sets, what makes the musical work so well is Kellogg\'s facility with rhyming dialogue (natural and rarely forced) and one of the most tuneful scores of recent vintage."" ', '""Shakespearean spoofs are almost as old as Shakespeare himself, dating back to at least the Restoration period. Although the vast majority has faded into history, there are still some real standouts like the classic musical \'Kiss Me, Kate,\' which thanks largely to Cole Porter is arguably even more enjoyable than its source material, a rare feat that the relatively new musical \'Desperate Measures,\' now in its second off-Broadway run, also accomplishes."" ', '""Deft direction and a snappy book and score delivered by a comically-gifted cast, this evening is the perfect compliment to these #metoo times…Highest comic marks go Ryan and Molina as secondary love interests Johnny and Bella… Although on the surface, the evening is played for laughs, Castellino subversively works in some of the Bard’s deeper themes of heartless unyielding law enforcement and sexual harassment—both alive and well four centuries later in Trump’s America.""

They stay true to their characters and deliver authentic and believable performances.” ', '“Abandons any pretense of wrestling with Shakespeare’s grander, weightier statements...but plays out like the early musicals of the 1930s...While it could be punchier and more socially relevant, I am hard pressed to think of another new musical as fun and, well, charming—a guilty pleasure that kept me smiling from start to finish...The score is abundantly smart and surprising, despite its subtlety, Kellogg’s book and lyrics are well-crafted and humorous.""

I am hard pressed to think of another ensemble as universally talented as the one assembled ...

It\'s happy just where it is.""   ', '""The revival is a home run. Do not hesitate to see it right. The nine main performers are superb, each one a star waiting to happen...Bergasse sets up little narratives in each song, so that Lieber and Stoller’s intent is realized whether it’s a hit or a rediscovered gem.

The musical staging can occasionally get a bit hokey, but that\'s more the exception than the rule.""

For those new to the music, the show is a great introduction to the talents of Lieber and Stoller.” "", '“Filled to the rim with knockout performances and musical moments that fly non-stop off the stage with such relish and energy...It’s impressive, but with so many songs stacked one on top of the other...My excitement started to wane...No story line to follow, nor any characterizations to pay attention to, just song after song performed with style and swagger...Cute, charming, funny, and vocally fantastic, but I’m learning that a plot-free review might just not be enough for this theatre junkie.” ', '""It is the most memorable example in the show of what we can call The Bergasse Workout, which I’m naming after the production’s inventive and obviously demanding director/choreographer Joshua Bergasse...A polished collection of musical numbers, a pleasant diversion...The revival feels more varied in tone, and includes some grit; Bergasse’s choreography often helps supply a sense of context.""

Recognizing this, Bergasse has removed the intermission and emphasizes hyperkinetic movement and audience interaction.” ', '""A revue of three dozen of these toe-tappers, entitled \'Smokey Joe\'s Café,\' made Broadway history two decades ago - and is now back in an energetic, excellently-performed revival at Stage 42. While this group of performers works superbly together, Bergasse does give each of his players their own chance to shine, and many of those numbers are among the show\'s strongest.""

It seeds into your heart, and blossoms with love."" ', '""Surprisingly fierce little musical...Ginsburg\'s lush orchestrations for piano, cello, and woodwinds give the music a sentimental air ideal for a story about the dredging of feelings long thought drowned. At the same time, the lyrics are honest and playful...Pappas juggles the overlapping plot lines with grace and precision. We\'re always aware of where we are...Brimming with warmth and clandestine power, this is one of those musicals that stows away in your heart without you even noticing.""

One exception to this is Harry’s telling of a tender moment he experienced in a concentration camp...There are 16 musical numbers in the play and they are the best element of \'A Letter To Harvey Milk\'...All of the actors have lovely Broadway voices and can sell a song.""

The music is lovely, while the lyrics...sometimes border on the simplistic or stereotypical, the story in the end is emotionally worthy of its telling...The actors\' voices feel like they belong attached to the songs...At times, the big conflict between Barbara and Harry feels dated, artificial, and overly dramatic...This is a letter worth reading and seeing.""

', '""Directed by Pappas from present to past and back again, the characters gradually unveil their secrets and come to appreciate the love, humor, hope and traditions of their lives...Newman\'s dialogue is overly generous with Yiddish colloquialisms...If not a timeless American musical, \'A Letter to Harvey Milk\' offers an honest truth in a time that needs it."" ', '""We engage in fairly familiar emotional territory with the main conceit centering on homosexuality and acceptance, with a large schmear of Jewish humor...A very strong book and the three lead characters are given a lot to say and think about. The story arc surprised me and was very effective in peeling back the layers within both Harry and Barbara, and the letter that was written. The music and lyrics range from garden variety to schtick...The ballads are very good and memorable.""

', '""Runs the gamut from Borscht Belt shtick to tenderness to tragedy...The lyrics by the late Ellen M. Schwartz supplemented by lyrics by Cheryl Stern are often clunky...Director Evan Pappas keeps the action flowing smoothly. If you are expecting a play about Harvey Milk, you will be disappointed.

', '""The musical really takes off in its second half...Overall \'A Letter to Harvey Milk\' is impressive and quite enjoyable, but could use further revision...While some of the numbers have lyrics that are quite poetic and beautiful, others are a bit on the nose. If it weren’t for the unexpectedly poignant turn the production takes in the second half, \'A Letter To Harvey Milk\' might be somewhat forgettable.""

', '""One of those musicals that just has a little too much happening at once...A haunting story that tries to achieve a bit too much...Quite possibly the biggest triumph of \'A Letter to Harvey Milk\' is its representation of a queer woman in a musical...It\'s safe to say that perhaps the source material may be flawed for adapting it into a stage musical. \'A Letter to Harvey Milk\' tells an important narrative. It\'s just the execution that is a little lacking...It\'s unfortunate how dated the show fee... ', '""There\'s a lot to like about this show, but it isn\'t wholly successful for a variety of reasons. First of all, in my opinion, 90-minute musicals rarely work. It\'s a tall order to develop characters, as well as relationships...While partially due to the short duration of the show, part of that is also due to the writers\' decision to include some of the dialogue within the songs like recitative...That said, the actors hold the musical together nicely."" ', '""Churning with good intentions, humor and delightful musical numbers...The play is curdling in a loaded plot, partly an homage to Harvey Milk...and a heavy-handed humanitarian message...Still there\'s plenty to enjoy thanks to earnest performances that tug at your heart and the entertaining musical score...The inspirational communications and backstory in the camps are spread with schmaltz but there is a lot of honey to savor.""

Unfortunately, the material is undercut by a bland and generic score...The performances are better than the material...Some of the early scenes move along a bit sluggishly, but director Pappas creates some effective stage images...Fall short of its musical ambitions, but the show does conclude with a sense of reconciliation, understanding, and, of course, hope.""

', '""An old-fashioned book musical with a ravishing score, expressive, illuminating lyrics, significant talent, remarkable visuals, war, deception, and love...‘Anastasia’ might be considered a primer for well-conceived musicals. Numbers organically elaborate on dialogue. Comic relief appears after quiet intensity. Past and present occupy the stage with cohesive luster...Altomare is grave and radiant. We’re with her every step of the way. Warm vocals wonder and soar."" ', '“The musical’s various elements are so finely fitted and its cast so accomplished that all comparison is quickly left behind. It is intelligent, well-crafted, often exhilarating…A great deal of the credit must go to the book by McNally…Altomare is wondrous as Anya…Her voice is luminous and powerful and clear…In the expansion of their film score, Mr. Flaherty and Ms. Ahrens have created something much more coherent and comprehensive while keeping its highlights.” ', '""The happiest surprise is how consistently good the musical turns out to be. Smartly adapted by Terrence McNally from the 1997 animated film...with Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens impressively expanding their score...\'Anastasia\' is a sweeping adventure, romance and historical epic whose fine craftsmanship will satisfy musical-theater fans beyond the show’s ideal audience of teenage girls...\'Anastasia\' is the richest and fullest family show to hit Broadway in years."" ', '""A sumptuous fairy tale of a musical that should please the kids, satisfy the sentimental and comfort those who thought the old templates for musical comedy were passé. The broad strokes of the familiar—a romantic young couple, a villain in hot pursuit, comic supporting characters—can still be irresistible when combined with taste, craftsmanship and a willing suspension of disbelief. Director Tresnjak, together with much of that first-class design team, weave an enchanting spell."" ', '""The 1997 beloved animated movie has been transformed into a magical new stage musical with a much-improved book by McNally, added songs from the film\'s composers, and a star-making performance by actress Christy Altomare...Modifications elevate the stakes at play, but also age the piece\'s target consumer...It may have taken 20 years for \'Anastasia\' to make its way from the screen to the stage, but this journey to the past has proven to be well worth the wait."" ', '""Dozens of small fixes have made it a much sharper show...It speaks and sings now with a stronger voice...Tresjnak\'s staging is reminiscent of classic operettas...McNally scripts some neat melodramatic showdowns...What matters most is that \'Anastasia\' has found its truest self. It is assured, it is lyrical, it is melodic, it is beautiful, it is dashing, it is moving and it is charming. It has no need for snark, irony or talking bats. It is off on a great adventure."" ', ""“No, that's not some forgotten Golden Age musical floating effervescently across the Broadhurst stage, but ‘Anastasia’ sure has the old-fashioned romantic feel of one…Director Darko Tresnjak's charming production is played on designer Alexander Dodge's simple unit set that frames storybook projections by Aaron Rhyne…While the story may be told in broad strokes, ‘Anastasia's’ attractively traditional score, good humor and winning performances make it a family-friendly delight.” "", '""Lushly orchestrated, gently delightful musical...\'Anastasia\' the musical chooses its own alternative facts, and does so with gorgeously sweeping music by Stephen Flaherty, courtly, crisp choreography by Peggy Hickey, grand designs by Alexander Dodge...The story, non-fatally, doesn’t have much story...Difficult questions about Russia and its past and future are raised and soon forgotten, with shrugs of shoulders and sighs. The performances are shining."" ', '""It’s an oft-told story, but the book, the score, and the imaginative staging by director Darko Tresnjak of an appealing cast tell it with infectious enthusiasm...Probably most spectacular of all is the set design, which utilizes to jaw-dropping effect the gigantic, eye-popping projections of Rhyne...An exemplar of entertainment that tries hard and successfully to give its Broadway audience its money’s worth. It may not elevate the art form, but it certainly keeps it happily afloat."" ', '“Despite the changes from the animated film ‘Anastasia,’ I left the theatre satisfied and happy. With such a strong leading female character, ‘Anastasia’ empowers women to follow their heart’s desires and not think twice about it. The character was a role model for my generation, and I hope for many more to come.” ', '""An uneven but well-meaning and mostly pleasant new Broadway musical...The highlights of the score are the pretty power ballads from the film...Too much time is filled with drawn-out scenes and new songs (also by Ahrens and Flaherty) that are not as memorable...As directed by Tresnjak, it looks elegant, moves seamlessly and makes unusually great use of background digital projections. Christy Altomare is smashing as Anya, with powerhouse vocals full of spark and sensitive yearning."" ', '“While this new version is a tad too overstuffed, both in terms of Flaherty and Ahrens’ score and McNally’s too-complex-for-tweens book, the result is still the kind of satisfying, family-friendly fare of which Broadway is always in too short supply...Tresnjak has directed the show with a very steady hand, rarely allowing the pace to lag over 2-and-a-half hours or the focus to go too far astray...If you have a young daughter, you’ll probably be rushin’ to catch this Russian-themed extravaganza."" ', ""“The intermittent pleasures of this bright, historical fairy tale are difficult to deny outright, even for those in deep denial about their own tiara-tinged aspirations…For a Russian epic spanning 30 years, Tresnjak’s staging is mercifully simple and deftly executed…But it’s a bold and appealing score, which includes new songs written for the stage, that makes 'Anastasia' float, showcasing the powerful voices of its cast and weaving memorable moments into a standard fairy tale.” "", '""One of the most extravagantly beautiful physical productions you’ll ever see. A masterpiece? Far from it. But \'Anastasia\' might be called breathtakingly competent...If the storytelling falls short of inspired, it’s consummately professional, and never dull...Lovers of well-structured, romantic musicals, and audiences hungry for a visual pampering, are likely to have a wonderful time."" ', '""A musical with true romantic sweep...Christy Altomare plays Anya with soaring vocals and an appealing vulnerability, but her sweetness would work better if it were studded with toughness from the beginning...Yet the production is strong enough to survive a mostly milquetoast Anastasia. It has exotic locales, funny secondary characters, incredible dresses, and some heart-flutteringly romantic moments. Plus it has all the ear-worm songs."" ', '“The show sparkles with the magic of imperial Russia through mesmerizing visuals, glittering gowns and emotional performances…A well-rounded and established fairy tale…Altomare stars as Anya, a role to which she brings all the heart, vulnerability and strength required…\'Anastasia\' as a whole thrives off of a familiar tale set to well-loved music...Of course there are minor setbacks; the constant repetition of the themes of hope and learning from the past tend to wear after a while."" ', '""Undeniably entertaining, but also relevant to the magical thinking that seems to have overtaken so much of the world...There are plenty of great performances in \'Anastasia\'...Sporting a bright and clear voice, Altomare is amiable as Anya, but not nearly enough of a presence to sustain this central role...In moments, \'Anastasia\' seems to transcend its cartoonish origins and become something one might not expect from the title: a serious Broadway musical."" ', '""\'Anastasia\' winds up promoting nostalgia for the last reign of the Romanovs, those elegantly attired autocrats who sponsored pogroms against the Jews...If the songs don’t offer the same power or allure as their scores for \'Ragtime,\' they are a clever and melodic enough accompaniment for what is the real strength of this production–its beautiful design and its wonderful cast...How the plot plays out will surprise no one, but there are some palpable delights along the way."" ', '""The splashy and animated postcard-like musical is pretty enough...It’s a real-life fairy tale crafted into a dreamy romantic musical directed with flair...Starts out thoroughly enchanting us with the lovely and engaging memory song, \'Once Upon a December\'...I only wish the rest of the show brought forth similar and stronger attachments and memories, more than what this pretty, but slightly dull musical is able to conjure."" ', '""The show, despite being filled with some very good songs and performances, suffers from its own identity crisis. It’s got a split personality and is torn between whether it’s serious drama or frothy musical comedy...Darko Tresnjak’s staging boasts momentum and atmosphere...While the show’s tone is muddy, Altomare has a bright, clear voice and shines in the lead role. Anya may or may not be a princess, but the actress playing her is a royal treat."" ', '""The show as a whole is a tad bland, though it’s beautifully staged...There\'s a workmanlike feel to the musical\'s construction. Lack of nuance in the writing makes the three leads, while vocally strong, quite vanilla...But Tresnjak elevates the material...It\'s kitschy, old-fashioned entertainment given a relatively sophisticated presentation, and you have to acknowledge its success when you hear the target demographic swoon on cue."" ', '""Works quite delightfully when the star is center stage, and struggles mightily when she is off in the wings, where the charming Christy Altomare spends far too long...A clunky start...Tresnjak forges some potent later scenes...This is not a musical that wants to start a revolution. To say the least. But once McNally\'s book finds its feet, and the physical production gets out of the way of the several gorgeous, old-school ballads therein, \'Anastasia\' has its moments of credible emancipation."" ', '“While Terrence McNally’s adaptation from the 1997 release unravels somewhat unevenly with gaps of uncertainty, the show proves enchanting to a young audience…Flaherty and Ahrens add numerous new songs, many unmemorable…Tresnjak’s directing flows…An ebullient cast led by Christie Altomare, who sparkles as Anya/Anastasia and Derek Klena as her supportive love interest carry this light family musical drama to its happily-ever-after ending.

Every song takes a moving journey and with Andrew Palermo\'s choreography the outcome is entertaining, heartfelt, stylized for the historic times that it brings to life.""

This story does not preach but unfolds like a novel you can’t put down."" ', '""This is a musical? You bet, and a darned passionate one, too. The carefully researched book by Marc Acito, Lorenzo Thione and Jay Kuo, who also supplied the soaring music and intelligent lyrics, collates years of events into a gripping trajectory, while the stirring score perfectly illustrates the action, seamlessly staged by director Stafford Arima. "" ', '""What struck me so much about this piece was not the music, normally my favorite entry point into the musical, but the storytelling...You must see this remarkable show. It is only here for two weeks and it will be one of those shows that if you miss it, you will regret it.""

What makes it stand out in the musical genre is that in the end there are as many questions as answers.""

Go see \'Allegiance.\' You will laugh, you will cry, you will applaud, and then you will stand up at the end to pledge your allegiance."" ', '""The musical is one of the best history musicals in years. The story of the relocation, and all of its problems, full of triumph and tragedy, is told eloquently. It is full of history and, at the same time, with superb acting, a strong plot and fine music, a pleasing stage musical for all...\'Allegiance\' is a must see for history lovers. It is a history lesson, but it is also stellar drama and good music in a bone-chilling and yet heart-warming story."" ', '""The injustices they and their neighbors endure can be felt through songs that tug at the heartstrings of the audience...When the denouement eventually drops, it does so in a torrent of emotions, leaving audience members with lumps in throats and tears flowing...My advice is: go see it sooner than later. When it eventually sells out, you’ll be proud to say that you saw this groundbreaking American musical."" ', '""\'Allegiance\' tells a story that is at once deeply personal and complex, and that boldly refuses the impulse to end in triumphant redemption…If the first act follows a somewhat predictable plot line, the second act gets decidedly more complicated...\'Allegiance\' succeeds as a musical on many levels. It is beautifully produced, and the cast shines through the performance."" ', '""Fearful as I am of the big Broadway musical, I left \'Allegiance\' Saturday afternoon delightfully blown away. This is really one musical you need to see...\'Allegiance\' is more than a well told historical play. It is a story of people and their stories. People living and breathing even in the face of the worst adversity, people trying to retain their spirit or \'Gaman\' a word used often here and people we so come to care for.""

Which is why it pains me to say that the music and lyrics don’t quite rise to the subject matter of this important and ambitious piece. But, despite that, I swear \'Allegiance\' deserves your attention.""

As always, Salonga is a vocal titan."" ', '""This is a production which features extraordinary talent. Broadway audiences are familiar with the stellar singing of Lea Salonga, and fans everywhere know George Takei as \'Star Trek’s\' Sulu. The real eye opener is Telly Leung, who possesses not only a full, rich voice, but also first class dance moves...The rest of the ensemble is uniformly excellent; this is definitely a heartfelt experience for both those in the cast and audience members."" ', '""\'Allegiance\' is the rare WWII-era piece of drama that actually feels fresh and necessary. A family splintering as they decide how to react to the internment is not a story that\'s been done to death, and \'Allegiance\' deftly handles the high emotions and conflicting schools of thought...While Takei is certainly the celebrity draw, this production is entirely worth seeing on its own merits. If you get the chance, check this one out."" ', '""Shockingly, it works: Not only is \'Allegiance\' a grandiose epic reminiscent of Miss Saigon, it also serves as a compelling family drama...\'Allegiance\' is delightfully old-school: a big schmaltzy musical of dubious historical accuracy delivered with ample humor and heart...Stafford Arima\'s fast-paced, ever-moving production reinforces that tone."" ', '""The real success of the \'Allegiance\' book, however, isn’t its depiction of injustice, which is vivid. What distinguishes the show is its extremely varied portraits of the Japanese-American characters…That’s a lot of history to pack into a two-and-half-hour show, and yet the authors and the cast (under the sure-footed direction of Stafford Arima) never reduce \'Allegiance\' to a lecture…It’s unfortunate that the score by Kuo doesn’t enhance this harrowing story."" ', '""\'Allegiance\' is more of an operetta than a musical. As such the characters find their voices in the music. There is little in the dialog that is remarkable or revealing. There is an interracial love story that livens up the plot, but other than that the story and the blocking are fairly predictable. Which is not to say boring. Because it is the music that tells the tale, and the music is quite wonderful...Ultimately what wins you over is the heart to heart connection. "" ', '""A majestic and moving musical, \'Allegiance\' is strikingly mounted under the direction of Arima...Many hands have helped give the production its impressive look in the face of the challenge of having to cover the sweep of family history as well as the trajectory of the war. \'Allegiance\' is a big show, but its success lies in the intimate ways in which it examines its characters and in their connecting emotionally with the audience."" ', '""The show isn\'t bombastic or preachy, though some may find the well-structured book too earnest. Kuo\'s serviceable score is loaded with anthems...Although we hear enticing Japanese flute and percussion between scenes, this more \'Le Miz\'-lite pop opera than a fusion of musical cultures. But I was engrossed throughout. The show has fully developed characters, a strong cast and a new story to tell in an old-fashioned way."" ', '""\'Allegiance\' is a sometimes moving, sometimes stodgy musical about this terrible injustice...George Takei has a strange way of growing on you. Even when he is the sullen older Sam he is movingly human, his face registering warmth and pain. He is heartbreaking in the finale. Stafford Arima’s direction keeps all the plot lines clear, smartly speeding things up in the second act so when all the emotional threads are woven together, the effect is quite moving."" ', '""It’s a poignant and well-crafted story, with a title that operates on multiple levels. Here, allegiance refers to the loyalty we feel for country. And, obligations we have to family and friends. And finally, truths we live by as individuals—the determination to stand our ground when life sours. All these ideas are woven smartly into the often-stirring drama."" ', '""\'Allegiance\' is both intimate and sweeping in scope. Director Stafford Arima keeps the action moving at a swift pace...Other elements have needlessly been polished to a Broadway shine, which undermines the story’s truthfulness...\'Allegiance,\' above all, has heart. And though it sometimes feels as though it’s been molded to fit a preconceived idea of what a Broadway show \'should\' look like, the musical’s relevance is a haunting reminder of how fragile and fleeting our freedom can be."" ', '""Maybe a bit schmaltzy, but heaven knows, we can all use some schmaltz these days...\'Allegiance\' is a story that needs to be told. We witness the enduring spirit of people during the most trying of times, and the power of love which incites transformation and redemption...I truly enjoyed \'Allegiance,\' but worry that it is not finding its audience.

The aesthetic is one part steampunk, one part Rose Art unicorns, one part Atari, and one part Studio 54…All this plays out in the beautiful Ars Nova space on Kris Stone\'s long runway of a set. Director Sam Buntrock keeps us moving through the show with expert pace and precision…It’s a wonderful theatrical event worth checking out before it ends its limited run.""

And another perfect example is Sky Pony’s \'The Wildness\'...This blurring of fact and fiction–characters who are named for their actors, who are both real, and not real–creates a delightfully sticky and engaging immersive experience...\'The Wildness\' taps successfully into the sound and feel of the millennial sense of seeking and alienation.""

The whole night was imaginative, catchy, and fun. And Lauren Worsham, the co-creator and co-lead, was nearly 8 months pregnant when I saw the end of the show’s run. Her character does not wear much and she owned her body with a fierceness I have not seen on-stage before.""

But judging by the young people in the audience clapping, dancing, and singing along, it\'s also the kind of buoying affirmation we all need to hear once in a while.""

It’s a very inspiring, glitter-coated femme-positive show in that respect. And despite the hard-candy exterior, the whole thing is shockingly earnest. Only in the final moments, where the fairytale and the real life merge, does everything else snap into context.""

', '""Brightly gripping, and written and directed in a classic fabulist style, it’s replete with innovative marvels of illusion; moreover, it centers on two of the more memorable puppet characters I’ve had the pleasure of meeting...The story deepens into sociopolitical commentary even as it expands into increasingly impressive feats of puppetry...For the most part, the story’s disparate elements turn out to have meaning as part of a cohesive narrative. There’s even a satisfying full-circle aspect."" ', '""The genius of \'Made in China\' is that with puppetry, everything is the same degree of artificial, which means that everything you see on that stage is equally real...American complicity in this Chinese industrial complex is touched on in a few moments in the play, but could certainly have been highlighted more...All together, \'Made in China\' is an impressive creation, an entertaining glimpse into the everyday and the fantastical all in one musical journey."" ', '“’Made in China’ is a puppet story and a delightfully savage satire of the way Americans willfully ignore the complexities of China while benefiting from its repressive policies and mass production chain…There are plenty of clichés about China here; the pleasure is in watching them get sent up like Chinese firecrackers…The other pleasure here is watching the ensemble at work: eight puppeteers plus the Norwegian Minensemblet performing live.” ', '""A surprisingly thoughtful story about the rise of modern China and our relationship to it as American consumers...Warnock and Waage\'s caffeinated and rigorous staging mostly offsets the effects of the unshorn script...The tone of \'Made in China\' is so often derisive that it is difficult to tell when the creators are being sincere...We walk away from the theater with a feeling of profound ambivalence, suspicious of the stuff in our apartments and wanting to know more."" ', '“A cartoonish romp that packs a feisty punch. The humor Warnock and Waage infuse is colorfully ominous, helping to ensure the message is heard loud and clear. With the puppet nature of the narrative, when the story goes off the rails, it is forgiven. In a way…If logic and politically correct theater is more your speed, \'Made in China\' is absolutely not for you. But if you like boundaries being challenged, Wakka Wakka has done so. It\'s not perfect but it\'s perfectly refreshing."" ', '""Despite some clunky chunks in the middle of its duration, \'Made in China\' is wacky and thoughtful, a bit obvious in its message perhaps, but with a good heart, and it is generally pretty funny—no particularly easy feat considering its references to a dark reality...The songs range from amusing to tedious...For the most part, the show is a highly digestible affair that is visually sweet and deceptively disturbing."" ', '""Unfortunately, the dogs are ditched about halfway through—when the shows big plot twist arrives—and the effects are noticeable. Mary and Eddie\'s characters are not very amicable in nature, nor are they very likable either. Sure, they are written genuinely, but as the show gets weirder and weirder, the focus strays from that of the duo\'s relationship to an obstructive and confusing political commentary which is both distracting and unclear."" ', '""Anyone who does not like fantasy definitely will not enjoy this show.  However, if you are interested in something that is completely different, you may enjoy the show. The puppeteers are talented and portray their characters well...The show is a musical although most of the songs are not very memorable...All in all the show is a very unique theatrical experience just not for children."" ', '""While the puppetry is of a high order, this musical’s theatrics mask a disappointing vacuity at the heart of the endeavor. The socio-political content of the piece seldom rises above simplistic disavowals of alleged Chinese labor practices and American obsession with money and consumer durables...It’s natural to wonder whether a clash of aesthetics among such disparate contributors may not be the cause of this show’s anemic socio-political perspective and the haphazard nature of its narrative."" ', '""In truth, ‘Made in China’ is headed in so many directions at once, it\'s hard to know what to make of it all. Its socioeconomic points are glancing at best…The script scrambles after laughs in various unseemly ways…So much creativity, so much bad taste: Despite the mastery of the theatre crafts on display, \'Made in China\' is a silly, superficial entertainment that pretends to a significance it can\'t really attain while aiming shockingly low for laughs.""

On The Town,"['""When did you last see a big-budget musical that made you want to shout with joy? If you’ve been feeling anxious about the lukewarm state of American musical comedy, get ready to get hot again: The new Broadway revival of “On the Town” is everything a great show should be."" ', '""Living in New York City, it’s easy to forget the fun of experiencing it all for the first time. It’s the sort of childlike discovery that makes even a crowded subway seem like a magical place. That unmitigated glee is alive and well at the Broadway revival of the they-don’t-make-‘em-like-they-used-to musical “On the Town.”"" ', '""And now, a show about sex that you can take the whole family to: the kids, the grandparents, even your sister the nun. That idea may sound kind of creepy, or (worse) dreary. But I assure you that the jubilant revival of “On the Town,” which opened Thursday night at the Lyric Theater, is anything but."" ', '""If \'On The Town\' does not hold the kind of sacred place as the flag or the Star-Spangled Banner, it is part of its own American tradition – an early American musical comedy classic. Not every production has been able to rekindle the original excited reaction to this savvy mix of silken song, dazzling dance and silly story – high-brow art in a pas de deux with middle-brow entertainment. This fourth Broadway production does.""  ', '""Playgoers who haven\'t walked away from a Broadway musical beaming since before they can remember should head over to Times Square...Comden and Green pioneered a fast and funny, comic sketch-style musical comedy while Bernstein loaded in a mixture of show tunes and highbrow stuff...This On the Town would leave them tickled pink and leaping for joy."" ', '""Director John Rando, choreographer Joshua Bergasse and music director James Moore have mined the show for all its raw poignance, without sacrificing any of its jazzy wit or exuberant romanticism...The result is a portrait of Town\'s primary subjects, New York City and young love, that will leave you both exhilarated and haunted."" ', '""Unless you bought a ticket expecting all-Misty, all-the-time, however, the first theater appearance by American Ballet Theatre\'s newly appointed first black principal dancer was an impressive and satisfying event...She definitely can act -- with her expressive body, of course, but also with her (heavily miked) voice. Her singing, the little she does here, has a gutsy quality that exudes personality, if not elegant tone.""  ', '""Re-electrifying a show in its dying days, ballet sensation Misty Copeland brings considerable charisma and elegant physicality to her Broadway debut. As you might expect of a theater novice, Copeland’s acting abilities conform to only a narrow range of accomplishment, oscillating between charm and vivacity. And the voice is most assuredly still a work in progress. But as for the real skill that landed her on the stage, well, on that count we’re in far more scintillating territory."" ', '""Her Ivy was terrific...Ms. Copeland’s singing voice may be flat, but this is a dancing role, and her Ivy has vulnerability and moxie. She lit up the stage of the Lyric Theater — enough to make you wonder: Is Ms. Copeland’s home on Broadway? Here, she finally looked like a star, more fresh and free than she’s appeared in ages."" ', '""Although Copeland\'s acting is stilted and her singing ability very modest, she acquits herself nicely in the role. She has a natural star quality accentuated by her striking beauty and all-American sex appeal, and her dancing, not surprisingly, is sublime. The part is small enough that her lack of acting experience doesn\'t weigh too heavily, and her lithe physicality is gorgeously illustrated in several dance numbers."" ', '""Three footloose sailors aren’t the only ones who get lucky in “On the Town.” The audience does, too. Director John Rando has assembled a great  cast for this fizzy and frisky revival. Tracing a tale of World War II tars on leave in the big city, the production feels like a big, juicy kiss. So pucker up, New York."" ', '""A glorious 28-piece orchestra playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in front of a giant American flag safety curtain has the audience on its feet before On the Town gets started. But it’s the jagged blasts of brass, the languorously bluesy romantic ballads and the exuberant comedy  numbers of Leonard Bernstein’s jazzy score that make this vibrant Broadway revival such transporting entertainment.""  ', '""Betty Comden and Adolph Green’s book and lyrics still crackle and pop after all these decades, and therein lies the rub: The show’s already written funny, so director John Rando’s frantic oversell can feel a little desperate...But that can’t dim the glittering gem that is “On the Town,” with its delirious, high-energy score."" ', '""The ants-in-their-pants revival of On The Town that snap, crackle and popped open on Thursday night is so unabashedly old-fashioned it could seduce a Red State senator. And yet it’s also so subversively fresh you may find yourself wondering when Broadway musicals got so stuffy."" ', '""Director John Rando admirably takes all the various components of such a big, splashy enterprise and makes it work.  The key is harmony, taking a spirited, care-free show and successfully balancing the extensive production numbers so the 2 ½ hour musical flows smoothly without unnecessary starts and fits."" ', '""“On the Town” is back on Broadway, and whaddya know, it’s still a helluva show...and although the young and vital cast is light on acting chops, the dancing is sensational.""  ', '""On the Town is a heartbreakingly youthful work: both about youth and by youth. Watching its three sailors pursue a lifetime of adventure while on 24-hour shore leave in New York, New York, you can’t help sensing the shadows of the three giddy pals who knocked the show together in 1944.""  ', '""John Rando\'s altogether loving, good-humored, skimpy-looking but imaginative frolic...We miss the shadow of World War II that surely must hover over young men on their last 24-hour shore leave before shipping out. Instead, this just is a breezy, peppy, pleasantly libidinous valentine to New York-New York that respects Leonard Bernstein\'s jazzy brainy score with a lush 28-piece orchestra."" ', '""Although it occasionally pushes too hard, John Rando’s production inspires considerable affection...I suspect there will be people who love the torch-carrying spirit of this On the Town, and I wish them, and it, the best.

', '""The competent cast provides a quirky array of characters that deliver an entertaining 90 minutes of comedy and with good vocals...The book by Stratford is steady but predictable. Kornfeld’s music is sufficient and lyrics by Higgin-Houser serve the characters...The book can use a bit more tightening especially addressing the one-liners that seem to fall flat. Even with these few obstacles, \'Numbers Nerds\' succeeds in being a very good product for the creator’s target audience."" ', '""There’s nothing wrong with it. But there’s nothing really spectacular either. It’s very middle-of-the-road, and wouldn’t offend, or inspire, anyone.

Big River,"['""The Encores! production of \'Big River\' is, in a word, perfect.

It’s spirited and lively and the cast couldn’t be better: up-and-comer Nicholas Barasch as the game but sometimes conflicted Huck; Kyle Scatliffe resonant and powerful as Jim; and a supporting cast of veterans that makes meals of every role."" ', '""Lear deBesonnet’s simply but thoughtfully staged production of this enchanting musical is both entertaining and enlightening...The entire production benefits from such savvy casting...One of the continually surprising elements of the show is the versatility of the score by Roger Williams...In this era where racism has reared back into the forefront of many people’s consciousness, Twain’s not-so-subtle commentary on slavery resonates in a way it didn’t in its previous two productions."" ', '""Magnificently played by its onstage ten-piece orchestra and sung brilliantly by its cast...Landesman has provided a streamlined concert adaptation of Hauptman’s book that allows the show to ebb and flow. Director Lear deBessonet and choreographer Rhodes have kept the staging streamlined and energetic, yet with plenty of wonderful dance numbers to satisfy...Hauptman’s book is weak in a lot of areas, but Miller’s score is lush and worth listening to. The Encore production is Broadway worthy."" ', '""An all-too-limited engagement justifies its existence with its winning exuberance, terrific performances, and the top-flight musicianship...Landesman has provided a streamlined concert adaptation of Hauptman’s book that keeps the episodic story line flowing as smoothly as the Mississippi River. But the show’s strength has always been the terrific score by the late Roger Miller...Director Lear deBessonet provides a lively staging...This is a \'Big River\' which deserves to flow on much longer."" ', '""With its delightful performances, lively staging, and Roger Miller’s sparkling country and bluegrass score, this Encores! revival of \'Big River\' is splendid and thoughtful entertainment...Mr. Barasch is onstage virtually the entire time and winningly carries the show. Kyle Scatliffe brings dignity, forcefulness and powerful vocal ability during his commanding performance...Director Lear deBessonet vigorously integrates all of the production’s elements into a compelling presentation.""   ', '""The relevance and appropriateness of \'Big River\' and its source material are open to question in the current political and cultural environment...In my opinion, both works take on extended relevance today...""The Encores! production proves to be unusually polished, dramatically compelling and often fun and joyful...A score based on the sounds of bluegrass, Americana and gospel is no longer a rarity, but \'Big River\' sounds as fresh and flavorful as ever here."" ', '“A simple yet enthralling production with no frills attached…This version of ‘Big River,’ the production let the music soar and the story take center stage while your imagination ran wild...Overall production was so strong, it\'s easy to forgive the lack of super power \'Muddy Water\' ended up having…Between a beautiful score and a classic story, Big River will shine on within the canon of musical theater. New York City Center has done an extraordinary job celebrating this work."" ', '""The Encores! production of \'Big River\' feels as twangy and bluegrass as can be, filled with melodic moments of beauty and history. It starts out floating on the charm and winning character of Huck Finn, played with the perfect balance of fire and freckles by Barasch...The weakness lies in the book, not the music or lyrics. The book attempts to address racism and slavery, and it does in many thoughtful ways, but seems to minimize Jim’s role in comparison to the teenage boys.""  ', '""It sounds better than ever...Scatliffe gives the standout performance of the evening: His delivery is vocally spectacular and he seems to sweat urgency from his pores...Lear deBessonet\'s production captures the matter-of-fact cruelty of the world according to Twain: Lines that make a modern audience blush are delivered without so much as a second thought...Everything comes together for Miller\'s distinctive country and bluegrass sound, which keeps our toes tapping throughout the evening.""

Sieber and Pittu do fine jobs as the Duke and the King. Sieber in particular, his character an actor by trade, hilariously mangles the words of Shakespeare in an attempted soliloquy...Deceptively simple and totally compelling, ‘Big River’ offers a strong lesson about people caught up in a painful moment in America’s past."" ', '""Though not crafted quite to typical Broadway standards, Miller\'s songs have infectious melodies and exude loads of character...The book by William Hauptman is solid, but perhaps a little less successful than the score, possibly because some of the book\'s shenanigans aren\'t as entertaining without Twain\'s inimitable voice...The production is blessed with a terrific cast...The stars of the show are the best reasons to see this \'Big River.\'"" ', '""\'Big River\' turns out to be more pleasant than polished. Though Miller wrote a very attractive collection of songs, few of them are specific to the characters and plot...Despite the significantly smaller cast and modest production values, deBessonet and her terrific company smoothly navigate the ever-changing landscape of the musical\'s episodic journey."" ', '""A new, lively concert-style staging...The plot is very incident-packed and a bit too sprawling. Still, the essence of Twain’s vision is there, wrapped in the twang-y country-style score mixed with passionate songs...Nicholas Barasch makes a delightfully rebellious Huck, who befriends Jim, played with dignity by Kyle Scatliffe…The production, set along the Mississippi River Valley in the 1840s, has some nifty numbers with the ensemble adding strength backing the soloists."" ', '""Miller\'s generous score, filled with bluegrass, country and gospel, is very much worth hearing. Some songs seem tangential, but the novel is so episodic that not much justification for a rousing song is necessary...Barasch is charming and sings and dances like an old pro. Jim, the slave, is a tricky part to play in the 21st century. Scatliffe gives him great strength, integrity and pathos...The production didn\'t win me over to Twain\'s book, but reminded me of of how talented Miller was."" ', '""A pleasant enough confection but with a bitter aftertaste...As rendered by a large, talented cast and a ten-piece orchestra of the usual Encores! caliber, Miller’s score holds up, a mix of honky tonk, bluegrass, rousing gospel and Miller’s signature novelty songs...This did not strike me as a weighty enough production...Lines should land harder than they do. Part of the problem may be Nicholas Barasch...His Huck is too bland, with little of the mischievous schemer in his eye."" ', '""If you are looking for a Huckleberry of irresistible sweetness and rambunctious naïveté, then Lear deBessonet’s buoyant Encores! production is the place to find him...Yet it can’t mask the feeling of anachronism that dogs this show...\'Big River\' feels like an awkward fit for this moment...It is hard to watch a story that’s framed as the tale of Huck and Jim without being bothered by how sidelined Jim is, and how very white and male anyone who has a substantial role is."" ', '""Emphasizing Miller\'s score only exacerbates the issues that already exist...It doesn\'t matter how good Rob Berman\'s orchestra sounds...if it all comes across as literature night at a condemned honky-tonk...This approach ends up transforming everyone outside the central foursome into extras rather than integral participants in the narrative...The problem with \'Big River\' in general, and this version in particular, is that you don\'t really care about much."" ', '""You will not be able to watch \'Big River\' without squirming...Other than Jim...the black characters are entirely undifferentiated and unattached to the plot...The authors treat Jim exactly as Huck and the others do: That is, they mostly ignore him...I’m not saying that a story about white people’s awakening to the immorality of slavery doesn’t deserve to be told. But in 2017 you can’t use a chorus line of slaves just to decorate that story with unmoored testifying and gospel thrills."" ', '""The 17 songs were the best things about “Big River” then. And they are the best part of the semi-staged concert revival...The show struck me as bland and surprisingly ho-hum in the original and, despite a fine cast in director Lear DeBessonet’s pleasant story-theater production, I still think the journey’s a bore...Nicholas Barasch has the presence and the look as Huck, though his singing only comes alive in duets with Kyle Scatliffe’s imposing, sensitive Jim."" ', '""Even if one were to accede that \'Big River\' could pass as a play with music rather than a traditional musical, the play itself is no great shakes. Hauptmann\'s book plods and meanders...The inert Encores! production certainly didn’t do the broad-brush songs and ambling script any favors. DeBessonet’s static staging only seemed to make the many dull stretches in both acts of the show seem to go on even longer. What few joys this Encores! staging provided were in the casting.""

', '""It’s a terrific spoof that had to happen by the only artist we know with the theater understanding and the dark heart to be able to pull it off...The 75-minute gem has just five performers of mad versatility, plus two priceless guest artists...The show’s verbosity, the imperfect rhymes, the too-fast-to-comprehend speed are all fair game...The courage, the did-he-really-say-that moments, Fred Barton’s pianism and, of course, the wigs, are all marvelous."" ', '""Smart, silly and often convulsively funny...Those who know their \'Hamilton\' will especially savor the meticulously warped mirror images of specific numbers...\'Spamilton\' has an energizing, free-associating euphoria that follows one theater obsessive’s prismatic \'mind at work.\' Given that \'Hamilton\' is itself a master at mixing anachronistic sensibilities, it feels appropriate that the fever dreams of \'Spamilton\' turn into surreal Broadway musical mash-ups."" ', '""Ingenious parody \'Spamilton\' simultaneously salutes and sends up Miranda and his signature musical. Much is owed to the agile five-member cast of actor-singer-spoofers, but the big kudos go to \'Forbidden Broadway\' creator Alessandrini...The overall tone of the satire turns out to be sweet, only slightly sour and never savage. But what else could be expected from Alessandrini, who has Miranda pegged as a fellow theater lover who worships at the same cathedral of Sondheim."" ', '""The bulk of the show is carried by a jaw-dropping ensemble in multiple roles...They drive the hilarity all 75 minutes; the laughs are huge and nonstop, and let’s face it: \'Spamilton\' may be the closest you get to \'Hamilton\' without going broke or waiting for years. Beneath the jokes and bitchery, there is a genuine critique—and it goes beyond \'Hamiltonian\' hegemony.""

These actors are in the best tradition of sketch artists, capturing character with the perfectly timed arch of an eyebrow or shimmy of the hips. And they’re mad singer-dancers. Alessandrini’s script is frequently up to that calibre, launching an arsenal of belly-laughs from a quiver that also contains its share of dulled barbs."" ', '""The music is fantastically done. Most of the songs parodied are from \'Hamilton,\' including \'His Shot\' where he sings, \'I am not gonna let Broadway rot!\'...Also, the cast does a great job with the lyrically dense numbers.""

Alessandrini repeatedly struggles to find a big idea that would skewer \'Hamilton\' in the manner of his classic takedowns...He is a tad lumbered by \'Hamilton\'s\' inventiveness and youthful high spirits."" ', '""The resulting parody is so infectiously fun that it could easily run as long as its inspiration...The talented five-person ensemble exuberantly impersonate their Broadway counterparts...\'Spamilton\' is not quite up to the level of Alessandrini\'s best work. Clearly enamored of the show he\'s spoofing, he\'s pulled his punches here. Many of the barbs are far less pointed than usual, more often inducing smiles than guffaws...But it\'s nonetheless a fast-paced and funny 75 minutes.""

While there are many hilarious moments, I found this show less consistently enjoyable than Alessandrini’s earlier efforts.""

He fares well enough with these...The huge saving graces throughout are Alessandrini\'s direction and Gerry McIntyre\'s choreography.""

Engaging performances, dynamic dancing and a lively orchestra make it the feel-good show of the fall...The lead performers are smashing, especially Pinkham...Bleu is a spark plug of energy, and his hoofing in \'You’re Easy to Dance With\' and \'Let’s Say It With Firecrackers\' are two of the musical’s dance delights."" ', '""The production breathes fresh life into a classic movie musical with a book updated to suit modern ears and stars who make familiar songs sound new again...Pinkham’s honeyed vocals and almost deranged charm make him the one to root for...Whether audiences are inclined to the show’s old-timey feel or nostalgic for its Berlin score, it’s Greenberg’s book with co-scribe Hodge that lends \'Holiday Inn\' an easy humor, one that doesn’t try too hard for laughs and often lands them one after another."" ', '""With \'Holiday Inn,\' co-librettists Greenberg and Hodge have come as close as anyone before them to creating what feels like an organically crafted musical from a set of inorganic parts...This \'Holiday Inn\' is an admittedly slight but charming diversion that’s old-fashioned in feel, but full of modern storytelling and staging know-how...Perhaps the most impressive achievement comes from choreographer Denis Jones, who whips up two crowd-pleasing, keister-kicking showstoppers."" ', '""Paired with Berlin’s incomparable and timeless tunes the classic show has found a new life with the talented cast...The standout performances belong to Pinkham, Lawrence and Bleu. Pinkham’s voice is enough to make even the most Crosby-crazed gal swoon and he has just the right combination of comedic timing, charisma and passion to play Jim...Bleu had a lot to live up to with the firecracker dance number...I had high expectations for the dancing and choreography and Bleu nailed it."" ', '""We only have to sit back and relax. Open our hearts to the beautiful Irving Berlin songs and take in with all the love we have of choreographer Denis Jones’s spectacular dance numbers...Greenberg and Hodge kept the joy and the fun, and got rid of the awkward moments in the film...Return to a place that is warm and optimistic, even if it is a fantasy land filled with lovely music and great tap-dance numbers."" ', '""So sweetly wholesome that you experience a sugar rush while watching it, the show is corny and predictable. But it will surely provide a happy diversion for stressed-out theatergoers during the holiday season...Pinkham and Gayer prove an appealing romantic duo, while Bleu displays his formidable singing and dancing chops in his underwritten role...There may be lulls in between, but this is a \'Holiday Inn\' you\'ll want to check into."" ', '""Though Greenberg and Hodges\' still rely on a feather-weight plot and feel-good nostalgia, it doesn\'t really matter. You see, the really new thing about their production is how smoothly they\'ve mixed songs from the Irving Berlin canon in with those from the original movie...The production numbers showcase Aleji Vietti\'s snazzy costumes as well as Mr. Jones\'s choreography. Jones does particularly notable work with the first act\'s jump rope routines in \'Shakin\'The Blues Away."" ', '""If you are stressed out by the state of the nation, get yourself to Studio 54 where you can return to a simpler, gentler America, at least for 2+ hours...The lively choreography by Denis Jones is well executed by a chorus of 16...The large orchestra and attractive arrangements give Berlin his due. And hearing \'White Christmas\' twice more won’t kill you. This Roundabout production may be the musical equivalent of comfort food, but a little comfort is most welcome these days."" ', '""Even though the authors have tried to insert some contemporary zest into this 1946-set story, the promise of newness is largely undeliverable. Thankfully, \'Holiday Inn\' embraces its traditional nature wholeheartedly, turning this premiere into a jubilant throwback to a bygone era...When Jones\' eye-popping steps are combined with the sounds of the elegant 13-piece band led by Andy Einhorn, \'Holiday Inn\' shimmers with that breathless pleasure only musicals can deliver."" ', '""This production of \'Holiday Inn\' is an instant classic. If you\'re expecting perfection, this is not your show. \'Holiday Inn\' is all about the fun...Even as a formulaic musical comedy, \'Holiday Inn\' fulfills the smile quota...Pinkham is a magnificent leading man. Pinkham’s charisma carried the show. Opposite Pinkham, Lora Lee Gayer is delightful...Broadway always needs a show that will do nothing short of entertain. \'Holiday Inn\' is that show this season."" ', '""The show is indeed old-fashioned — but in a very pleasant way. It doesn\'t poke smug fun at itself, or, at the other end of the attitude spectrum, pretend with a straight face that tastes haven\'t changed in 75 years. Rather, it takes an appealing middle ground...Though \'Holiday Inn\' might be a musical constructed according to a formula, it\'s a winning example of the type. Forgettable, perhaps, but fun while you\'re watching it."" ', '""Book yourself into \'Holiday Inn\' just to see the pyrotechnics when tap whiz Corbin Bleu dances around, dodging faux explosives that are snapping at his feet. The \'High School Musical\' star breathes into it new life...\'Holiday Inn\' is a lovely excuse to get lost in the Berlin chestnuts, particularly as they’ve been reimagined by choreographer Jones. The new story sometimes tries too hard to be charming and old-fashioned, but overall \'Holiday Inn\' is a satisfying autumn offering."" ', '""Director Gordon Greenberg and his co-book writer Chad Hodge, and most certainly choreographer Denis Jones, have avoided all things familiar in their various departments and have certainly turned this old thing into something new again...If there was ever a slight bit of shakiness in the second act plot line, I was more than willing to give the show that chance to catch its breath. Certainly the cast played as though every moment hit home, and sure enough, it found footing once again."" ', '""It’s a show filled with the old-time virtues of old-time Broadway musical comedy. Nothing groundbreaking, provocative, intense or jolting. Just sit back and enjoy...The real strength of the show, as you might expect, though, lies in the Berlin hit parade...The plentiful choreography by Denis Jones often pumps them up to near show-stopping glory...True, the Jim-Linda romance never really sizzles with passion. However, those Berlin tunes provide all the romance you could want."" ', '""Director Greenberg presents the Berlin songbook with a glow of romance and spice of fun...Pinkham adds charm and smooth tenor tones, lending a shy sexiness to Jim, but Corbin Bleu, as a self-involved, high-octane dancer, does not lend much personality or depth to his thinly sketched part...Greenberg and Hodge’s book is slight, but the performances, the music and the production are unpretentious, bright and fun. \'Holiday Inn\' is old-fashioned fun any time of the year."" ', '""Directed with generosity and warmth by Gordon Greenberg — and as performed by a pair of dashing and very endearing leading men, Bryce Pinkham and Corbin Bleu — this \'Holiday Inn\' wears down all defenses...That all of these songs work together is more a testament to the sturdiness of Berlin\'s music — and the excellent singing throughout — than Greenberg and Hodges\'s script, which doesn\'t always make sense...Flaws and all, \'Holiday Inn\' leaves you unreservedly happy."" ', '""There’s virtually nothing new about \'Holiday Inn\'...The characters are so stock they’re practically cardboard. And the \'plot\' is pretty much just a clothesline on which to hang Berlin’s songs. Still, you’d have to be a total Grinch not to melt even a little during Berlin’s comforting-as-cocoa Christmas ballad. And who couldn’t succumb to the charms of the tap-happy \'Shaking the Blues Away\'...That’s all it takes to get the audience immediately into the holiday spirit."" ', '""It’s a simple plot, typical of musical comedies from the \'40s, mostly meant to entertain and be the conveyance for songs and dances. Lots of songs and dances. And by this measure, the new old-fashioned musical is entirely pleasant. It’s fun and fluffy, and has a creamy, sorbet-colored palette that’s pleasing to the eyes. The book feels fresh and modern, though some of the modernisms come off as a little anachronistic. That’s no bother, though."" ', '""This pleasing update includes memorable songs from that film plus a few other stylish Berlin tunes...The nostalgia factor is amped up with plenty of full, splashy dazzling dance numbers and lavish costumes. Jones has filled the cavernous stage with exuberant choreography, and the nimble, hardworking ensemble is airborne one minute, then dreamily waltzing the next...This tuneful confection of standards definitely harkens back to the golden age of musicals."" ', '""The musical’s book, by Gordon Greenberg and Chad Hodge is, at times, much too predictable, while its moments of self-conscious satire are welcome...But the spirit of the story, as well as the cast, who are directed by Greenberg, is infectious. Pinkham, an accomplished stage actor, brings a self-deprecating charm to the role of Jim, while Bleu’s joy at tapping on Broadway is apparent in every scene...It’s a good time for this tap-happy burst of optimism to arrive on Broadway.""

Children and adults alike can gain fresh pleasure from this production...Despite their youth, the performers come with considerable experience, and it shows.

The cast seems to understand this and enjoyably communicates that outlook.""

But having kids do it makes it fresh, appealing, and endlessly cute (but not cutesy). The show is basically a series of vignettes and songs, like a comic strip come to life...As directed by Michael Unger, they do a lovely job...Shapiro projects a wonderful wisdom of the ages in her face, making her a priceless character actress even now.""

Capable as they are, none is especially outstanding, although Gemme’s Snoopy has a delightful Hamish Linklater vibe, Villas displays impressive dance chops, and Colley sings sweetly.

When presented earnestly, the show doesn\'t quite work...It feels like a more disturbing look at a desperately unhappy youth and his awful pals.

That said, I was delighted to see so many kids in the audience of an off-Broadway show.""

In Transit,"['""A most appealing ensemble has been gathered to handle the perfectly marvelous book, music, and lyrics…They have given us the most literate, incisive, and fun lyrics we’ve had since the great days of Hart, Fields, Hammerstein, Ebb, Harnick, Lerner, and yes, even Coward, and the unique Stephen Sondheim himself…What was once a charming mouse of a show has been turned into a ‘mouse that roars,’ and I think it will appeal to all who’ve ever dreamed a dream."" ', '""Is it gimmicky? Who cares when it’s this satisfying...While the show is episodic in nature, the four-person writing team succeeds in making us care deeply for every single character...Veteran director Kathleen Marshall keeps the actors focused on their destinations which creates a constant, upbeat feel that they are always on the go. The result is a continual sense of flux that keeps the show safely away from stasis...This is my pick for the sleeper hit of the season."" ', '""An upbeat musical that will cheer you up as it is made up of fantastic music…The choreography by Kathleen Marshall is very uplifting and energetic...The energetic and talented company made the show a joy to watch. The sets were simple but worked and made you believe you were on a train with rats included. This show is a lot of fun and the music, all made by the human voice, is stunning…Go and see ‘In Transit,’ a show that is positive, upbeat and fun."" ', '""Rarely has Broadway seen such an effective love letter to New York, not since Lin-Manuel Miranda’s first hit, \'In The Heights.\' Very few shows have so realistically portrayed what life is like on the streets of Manhattan and do so in an entertaining fashion...All of the 11-member cast are superb in their roles...\'In Transit\' puts it all together to create one of the most creative and enjoyable musicals on Broadway."" ', '""Marshall has turned up the volume just enough, giving it a more insistent pulse, a sense of nonstop movement that proves highly suitable to the occasion...The songs are the thing here, and they neatly capture the tone of a city where everybody is on the way to somewhere new...\'In Transit\' is also fitted out with a solid cast of Broadway utility players, each of whom gets a chance to shine...Marshall\'s kinetic staging concentrates on the warp and woof of city life, keeping things buoyant."" ', '""The cast are all simply magnificent in their vocal and acting abilities. It’s really incredible what they can do vocally, especially the one referred to as ‘Boxman’...Without his extreme talent, I would guess that the a cappella sound would wear thin in this 90-minute musical, but it never does...On the surface the stories seem standard, but as we keep riding along with the young, fresh, and super-talented cast, we become invested and surprised by the twists and turns."" ', '""The creative, a cappella musical that was so entertaining in its off-Broadway version has now moved to Broadway and, in its larger space, is also entertaining…The direction and choreography by Kathleen Marshall make the company come across with sparkle…The solos are generally striking, and when the company breaks loose in song as a unit, such as in the finale, the effect is electric. \'In Transit\' merits a stop on anyone’s theater going circuit."" ', '""A joyful, heartfelt, complicated celebration of New York City that will appeal to most tourists and jaded locals like myself…It’s Marshall’s sensitivity to the material that keeps ‘In Transit’ in tune…The cast of ‘In Transit,’ with their pitch-perfect harmonies and purposeful movement, will gently tug at your heartstrings. In these times of \'us versus them,\' there’s a bigger message they’re delivering: We’re all in this together, and love and compassion are notes worth holding on to.""

But for sure, they are fun, they are mostly real, and definitely New York stories...It was basically tightened, honed, and amp\'d up just a bit for the Broadway...Choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, the movements are brisk, crisp, and keep the show\'s train moving forward...This incarnation of the show is zippy, toe-tapping, touching, and upbeat with a heartwarming message."" ', '""Director/choreographer Kathleen Marshall keeps the plates spinning with nary a dull moment...You can guess where it’s all going to go, and you don’t care. Because every member of the cast is charming, the songs utterly infectious, and every single time they open their mouths to spin their glorious harmonies you completely forget how many times before you’ve heard all those theatrical tropes and concentrate on how rarely you hear voices like these."" ', '""Loved the stories and the catchy music...Appealing for the younger crowd, as a cappella music has become a huge trend in recent years...The songs are catchy and fun but also sentimental at times...The staging is really cool--the audience sits around a subway platform so no matter where you sit you have a great view."" ', '""Hits all the right notes for a musical. There are all of the typical Broadway tropes and the show tunes incorporate everything from beatboxing to the blues, all with a nice tinge of New York City cynicism...Considering that every note, melody, and harmony came from a human mouth, foregoing the normal orchestral accompaniment, \'In Transit\' was a phenomenal show of artistry.""  ', '""The songs themselves are an appealing collection of catchy pop numbers, rap and Latin rhythms, staged with spirited bounce by director/choreographer Kathleen Marshall...\'In Transit\'s\' view of the city teeters between romanticized and sanitized...Happy endings come to those who work for them and the pulse of Gotham is a multicultural mix that sounds glorious as sung by the talented company. Leave your cynicism on the other side of the turnstile and swipe yourself in."" ', '""The most wonderful thing is that \'In Transit\' is sung a cappella and sung so richly and well you imagine hearing musical instruments where there are none...\'In Transit\' aims to make a range of unheard voices and unseen lives real...It makes no special pleas for understanding, it is not dripping in irony. And it has a sweet heart wrapped in a hard fist...An honest and beautifully sung testament to New York."" ', '""What, at first, seems like a series of sketches turns into a full musical, with story arcs and characters for whom we root...What\'s so incredible, of course, is what these actors are doing with just their voices...The a cappella arrangements are astounding...\'In Transit\' tells a mostly simple and somewhat predictable story, but the New York insider jokes and incredible vocal prowess make it an enjoyable ride."" ', '""A charming a cappella musical of metropolitan life that’s rapturously harmonious...What gives \'In Transit\' its new swipe is what’s not there—the orchestra—and what is—glorious, pitch-perfect voices, set to Deke Sharon’s rich and expressive arrangements...The book is by-the-numbers, with the audience’s minds moving ahead of the plot faster than a scurrying subway rodent. All the performers bring a high degree of likability to otherwise plaintive roles...It’s a surprisingly moving experience."" ', '""I enjoyed it…The show is a cappella, not just to put musicians out of work, but to give it a throbbing, real NYC feel, which is well carried off, complete with a sort of narrator emitting sound effects…The actors were terrific, especially Justin Guarini and Moya Angela, who’s hilarious...The resulting plots may be a little too \'Love American Style\' for comfort and the subway may seem a bit too sanitized, but generally this is a slick and likeable excursion that advocates enjoying the ride."" ', '""Like most shows that aim to be representative of a large community, \'In Transit\' isn\'t nearly as inclusive as it intends to be...And none of the stories that unfurl here are especially original...But the cast is so winning, and the musical numbers so vibrant and playful, that you should find yourself in a forgiving mood...And for a show that might have been little more than a novelty act, there are moments of surprising emotional forthrightness."" ', '""The point is a rah-rah one — we\'re all instruments in the amazing, living musical that is New York! That\'s a sweet thought, and this is a sweet, earnest musical…These aren\'t fresh topics and the show barely dips into them. But ‘In Transit’ is charming, fun, and well-staged, with a few clever inside jokes. I suspect that newish, 20-something arrivals will find their lives reflected back in a hopeful mirror."" ', '""The musical relies entirely on acappella, which fits into the interweaving of its characters well. This creates a great sound that supports the story’s themes of interconnection. Those themes, however, feel a little light...Where it lacks in thematic profundity, the show shines with its humor, delivering a charming and witty love letter to life in the city. Directed by Kathleen Marshall, the wonderful performances bring out the show’s many brilliant comedic moments."" ', '""A small-scale, crowd-pleasing show...Personal issues are played out primarily through catchy songs that smartly capture the characters’ emotional states, each of which is beautifully performed. Moreover, it’s a great testament to these fine actors that they deliver a second dimension of sorts to their sketchily drawn alter egos...They’re a little too clichéd for us to fully care about about whether they get their happy endings...Marshall moves the show at a steady, slightly unrushed pace."" ', '""\'In Transit\' is a fun, feel good musical. And that\'s about it...Even with redundant and predictable plot lines, they still managed to bring a smile...The score featured some great songs. But even with a cast of 11, there were moments when Deke Sharon’s arrangements felt thin...Marshall did all she could to make \'In Transit\' more than a fluffy musical comedy. Trying to find the weight in the material never quite happened so Marshall opted for gimmicks. And they worked, some of the time."" ', '""This is a production which feels very much like a singing sitcom that could fit nicely in the FOX Tuesday evening lineup. The voices are pleasant, the characters and their situations are highly familiar without being totally cliché, nothing overly depressing happens and the Manhattan subway system looks like it was shot in Toronto...\'In Transit\' markets itself as Broadway’s first a cappella musical, and it’s a successful gimmick thanks to the creative team."" ', '""\'In Transit\' takes that most harped-on of artistic cliches—it’s the journey, not the destination—and builds it out, with a superior cast and some catchy music...Some of the storylines played out unpredictably in the best of ways. At other times, \'In Transit\' settled into overly worn devices...\'In Transit\' manages to create a reality-distortion field that left me feeling the MTA isn’t the hostile environment I know it all too well to be...Go ahead and swipe your MetroCard.""

Hadestown,"['""It’s a good time show for bad time times, a hoot that hits its political points hard...Mitchell sticks close to the original myth, fleshing its slight narrative out in song, but she soaks her score in contemporary Americana. It functions like a folksy, old patchwork quilt, pulling musical influences in from across the land...It’s Mitchell’s music that makes \'Hadestown.\' Infectious without trying too hard to be catchy, her songs heat up as the show heads down to hell."" ', '""\'Hadestown’ is not perfect, but it is really, really good. The wonderfully diverse songs of Mitchell’s expanded, virtually sung-through soundtrack are the bedrock...It is a musically thrilling, lyrically eccentric articulation of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth that has gratifyingly little to do with musical theatre convention...It’s a brilliant staging of an album, but nonetheless, the characters and plot are wholly contained within the relatively impressionistic songs."" ', '""Whether you call it a folk opera, a hip oratorio or a musicalised myth, it boasts some cracking songs that far outweigh its dramatic shortcomings...Chavkin’s production, even in a large space, preserves the rough theatre elements that are part of the show’s charm...I’m not sure if Mitchell’s classical update imparts a palpable message, but her beguiling melodies linger on."" ', '""Mitchell and her co-adapter, director Rachel Chavkin, cleverly weave in the story of Hades and Persephone...Mitchell’s songs incorporate elements of blues, New Orleans jazz, and rock...The lyrics and book are, however, less impressive...Yet a similarly informal aesthetic becomes a virtue in Chavkin’s direction. She creates a feeling of organic freedom...The journey of the story is both enjoyable and engaging."" ', '""A defiantly original musical. Its story is thin, transposing the well-known Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to Depression-era America. But musically it’s a feast...A show that’s lush and haunting, even if overlong...The topical significance, especially in the song Why We Build The Wall, won’t be lost on anyone...With its emphasis on mood rather than action, this is the sort of show that risks being labelled portentous. But it’s tightly choreographed and genuinely inventive."" ', '""Its cleverness – and it is a phenomenally smart show – is that it takes that age-old story and makes it spark in many directions...Its brilliance is to take those ideas and set them – in Chavkin\'s truly inspired production – in a kind of Depression-era speakeasy...Chavkin makes joyful use of the many variants of the Olivier\'s revolve...Her always stylish direction is massively assisted by David Neumann\'s energetic but finely honed choreography."" ', '""Here is one of the great lost-love tales of all time. If it falls a little short in this jazz musical, that is because the whole enterprise is a touch too hip for characterisation or humour to flourish. But this is a show with plenty of spectacle...Despite a certain level of nonsense, the show trots along and has a handsome swagger."" ', '""An evening of evident cohesion...The journey at times threatens to feel interminable...Elaborate drama is in scarce supply. Mitchell’s through-sung approach squeezes out opportunities for richly character-defining dialogue...Before the stinging, melancholy payoff, an almost deadening repetition creeps in that Chavkin’s beautifully lit and propulsive production can’t quite mask...The show finally delivers the heart-stopping goods, but is it fully achieved yet?"" ', '""It oozes cool...The gothic-tinged, old country blues and jazz of Mitchell’s expressionistic score played with laid-back élan by an on-stage band. It’s unusual for a new musical to feature songs that feel like ready-made classics: this one has them in spades. The problem — and it’s a big one — is Mitchell’s book, which overloads the original myth with crude 21st-century relevance...The sepulchral funk score is a blissed-out delight, but it can’t overcome the show’s dramatic shortcomings.""

Beardo,"['""A wonderfully strange new musical...Overflowing with mystery and mirth, this tragicomic riff on a familiar tale is an unforgettable theatrical experience...Malloy employs an eclectic mix of styles for a score that is both tuneful and daring...Surprises abound in Heyman\'s earthy production...\'Beardo\' thrillingly leaves us to ponder what we just saw and to distrust any immediate conclusions we might make about it."" ', '""\'Beardo\' is near brilliant, played with pitch-perfect timing by the cast, particularly Damon Daunno, in a star-making turn...If this is kept from falling into juvenilia, or just pure silliness, it is largely a credit to the tight direction from Ellie Heyman.

The repetition employed throughout the score and book is cute the first time, but I suspect would fall flat with repeated viewings...I\'ll always seek out a Malloy show from now on. It\'s a guaranteed unique, high value and immensely original experience."" ', '""Some of the elements familiar from \'Great Comet\' are present, most notably Malloy’s classically tinged, eclectic score offering everything from rock ballads to hearty drinking songs, as well as a game and talented cast. But \'Beardo\' feels in comparison like a work in progress. The book and lyrics are playful, sometimes clever, silly, ribald, deliberately anachronistic, joyfully shocking and in-your-face weird. They are too accomplished to be labeled juvenile but \'adolescent\' might fit."" ', '""The production is sometimes adventurous, sometimes euphoric, and sometimes downright ludicrous...Craig can be surprisingly clever and sometimes the songs are oddly touching. The cast is terrific in its commitment to the eccentricity of the work...Damon Daunno shines as the protagonist...Even when the book provides no context for the action leaving the audience bewildered, Daunno keeps us grounded. Director Ellie Heyman creates a wonderful atmosphere for the actors to play in."" ', '""A louche, lewd and assertively weird fantasia on the life of Rasputin...Those lacking familiarity with pre-revolutionary Russian history may find themselves befuddled...This ought to be dark, ribald, rambling entertainment. And it is. But it also isn’t...Heyman approaches the material with gusto, conjuring some visual and sonic surprises, playing down the politics. But art alters as times change, and this show now seems less bouncy, more hollow and more queasy than intended."" ', '""\'Beardo\' is a dangerously evocative musical that is breaking the mold...There are some flaws. A bunch. Some whiffs in the script. Is there room for trimming? Absolutely...This company certainly had a blast...\'Beardo\' is a beautiful mess of a musical that knows exactly what it is. And that’s what makes it, well, charming. If you take the show at face value, you’ll likely not get it. If you do a tad bit of research and allow yourself to embrace it for what it is, you’re bound to appreciate it."" ', '""Scruffy and messy, which is fun for a bit—before you start yearning for dramaturgical focus and stronger direction to bring out a decent musical...Director Ellie Heyman has fine individual ingredients to work with: Craig’s goofy-eerie dialogue and lyrics, Malloy’s folksy pop and a cast bursting with talent. It’s the integration of those elements and themes that doesn’t work...A novelty-song cycle grafted onto an absurdist historical fable, \'Beardo\' needs trimming."" ', '""The entire enterprise suffers from a deficit of wit and the absence of a point of view...That \'Beardo\' doesn\'t become entirely tiresome until late in the second act is largely due to Malloy\'s music...There isn\'t much that the director, Ellie Heyman, can do to impose any order on such often chaotic proceedings...Neither a comic romp, a pointed satire, nor a gripping historic episode, \'Beardo,\' the musical, is little more than a superficial display of look-at-me cleverness."" ', '""Adventurous but unfocused...Two and a half hours of a horny mansplainer who seemed to feel zero compassion for anyone and viewed himself as flawless...Most of the jokes in \'Beardo\' go on for far too long...Rasputin has long been the subject of cultural fascination...but modernizing him through adolescent humor and cheap jokes, and making him nothing more than an entitled man-child, is not an effective or creative way to explore this subject.""

The cast isn’t a bad place...The moving bodies are mesmerizing, and Blankenbuehler makes certain the movement rarely slows."" ', '""A slavishly faithful revival...\'Cats\' remains precisely what it always was, a tuneful ball of coiled dancers’ energy and the useful vehicle for a discovery of the wonder of musical theater...The cast assembled for the revival is gangbusters. Andy Blankenbuehler has been recruited to tweak the dances of \'Cats’s\' original choreographer, Gillian Lynne. His refinements inject precision and verve...Lewis, for her part, is blessed with power to spare but is emotionally inert."" ', '“\'Cats\' isn’t trying to be anything it’s not.

How can you not love these crazy kids when they’re putting so much gosh darn effort into it?...\'Cats\' is never pretentious — it’s unabashed Broadway glitz.""

It works best as a showcase for the energetic young cast and what it does best – which is dance...If the lyrics are largely lost in the swirl, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s score holds up. The performances, though, are uneven."" ', '“Memories could be fatal to this revival—specifically, the memory of Betty Buckley as Grizabella, singing ‘Memory\'...Leona Lewis isn’t in her league. Happily, nothing as catty can be said of the rest of this fabulous revival of the 1981 musical phenom...A corps of brilliant dancers leap with feline agility through every style of dance, from toe-tapping Broadway jazz steps to the classic ballet moves...The genius of the show is in the dancing...The dancers are in perfectly splendid form.""

As a wistful recollection, ‘Cats’ is guaranteed to leave you feline groovy.” ', '""Much like the animals that inspired it, \'Cats\' is divisive...It is also hands-down the most openly bizarre piece of entertainment to ever be so popular...The cast assembled here delivers 110 percent. There’s something marvelous about a chorus line of expressive cats eliciting applause simply by moving downstage. No smoke and mirrors or clever rap lyrics, just heavy makeup, unblinking stares, and bodysuits with tails.""

She has no acting credits in her bio and it shows, making the evening\'s climactic moment a sad letdown."" ', '“The overriding spirit of the revival appears to be the familiar motto: Don’t mess with success...The most significant nod to the intervening decades and changing tastes is the hiring of Andy Blankenbuehler...The felines prance and romp and occasionally hiss at one another as they introduce themselves in songs that provide the show’s greatest allure, as well as its variety. Mr. Lloyd Webber is a musical magpie...The cast for the revival is largely excellent."" ', '""Only hardcore fans will be able to spot the differences in this new version...The biggest change is the new choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler...More athletic and stylistically diverse than before, the dancing here is particularly spectacular...Lewis reveals her lack of acting experience with her less than galvanizing Grizabella, but her powerful singing is not to be faulted...Enough time has passed for a new generation of theatergoers to embrace the show."" ', '""No doubt the success of the 2014 revival of \'Cats\' in London encouraged the producers to bring it back to New York. And wisely, they\'ve done so with a new cast of top to bottom standouts and vital and fresh choreography that retained the feeling of the original. This does indeed boost the show\'s strong points...The ballet sequences seem especially take-your-breath-way spectacular...\'Cats\' may not be a great musical, but it\'s a great visual spectacle expertly performed."" ', '""There is nothing really new in this current revival of \'Cats\'...Unchanged is the somewhat discordant presence of what Mr. Webber has imagined as the main character of \'Cats:\' the Glamor Cat Grizabella...That said, the named Cats and the Cats chorus provides sufficient energy to overcome this significant flaw in the current production...\'Cats\' will continue to excite the senses of the young and the not so young and the musical will still embody the brilliance of the poetry."" ', '""I still can’t say \'Cats\' is my favorite musical ever—far from it—but I enjoyed this revival...Blankenbuehler’s rejuvenation of the original Gillian Lynne choreography electrifies the exuberance and musical excitement on stage...A few must-mention felines in this powerhouse cast...Quentin Earl Darrington, Christopher Gurr, Ricky Ubeda...The only disappointment is Leona Lewis...Even with its faults, you cannot help but indulge in the spectacle of fabulous dancing and whimsical charm."" ', '""\'Cats\' may not have much of a story, but it has some of the best dancing around. It also has an engagingly melodic score...In any other show the lack of subtlety would be a serious negative, but other shows don’t have six-foot tabbies who like to walk on their hind legs...\'Cats\' is an entertainment, made of song and dance, both of which it’s got covered in spades.

It’s hard to imagine a better match of actor and role: It is, in a word, perfection…‘Hello, Dolly!’ may be a vehicle for its star, but this revival treats it like a vintage Rolls-Royce. From the rousing overture on, everything about the production, directed with joyful aplomb by Jerry Zaks, gleams with old-fashioned charm…Jerry Herman’s exuberant score is a show-tune bonanza.” ', '""The two-time Tony Award winning performer has brought a poignancy to the production that wasn\'t quite in evidence with her predecessor...Which is not to say that she falls short of the role\'s comedic demands. Her performance is less vivacious than Midler\'s, but no less hilarious...If Garber\'s more restrained performance is less gut-busting, it\'s also less of a caricature...Stemp is a revelation...Zaks\' perfectly tooled staging hasn\'t lost a step, dancing or otherwise, since the show opened."" ', '""I’ll just come right out and say it: I prefer Donna Murphy over Bette Midler in \'Hello, Dolly!\'...Murphy fires from all cylinders and never lets up, bursting with vitality and comic ingenuity...Murphy is also in full voice. Her powerhouse singing takes the production numbers up by more than just a notch...People should not shy away from this lavish, lovingly old-fashioned, euphoric revival simply because they cannot score tickets to see it with Midler.""  ', '""The role of Dolly Gallagher Levi fits Midler like a glove. She captures Dolly’s energy, determination, vulnerability and humor effortlessly. Her voice is still a pleasure to hear and her dancing ain’t bad either...The producers cast the show profligately, splurged on lavish costumes and sets, excellent choreography, a large orchestra, and a top-notch director...Jerry Herman’s sturdy songs hold up very well. They don’t make shows like this anymore. For sheer entertainment, it is hard to beat.""  ', ""“Hello, Dolly!’ itself is terrific, and director Jerry Zaks and his unassailable company have elevated it to a stratospheric level…It's dopey, predictable, and perfect. This is due in no tiny part to the airtight construction of Stewart's book…Herman's score is more memorable still…To the extent that this ‘Hello, Dolly!’ stumbles—and it isn't much—it's because Midler falls short…She may be a gleaming star, but she's not a transformative one…About as good as the Broadway musical gets.” "", '""This is a by-golly-and-thank-you-Jesus \'Hello, Dolly!\' show...In Peters we have an actor who connects with her character.

But the show draws attention to her. She builds Dolly’s character...Garber and Peters have chemistry that Hyde Pierce and Midler did not share...The songs in \'Hello, Dolly!\' just seemed more integrated, deeper, richer...If you’re a real Broadway fan, and not just here for the stunts, this is the real thing."" ', '""Bernadette is not Carol and certainly not Bette but she has more musical comedy talent than anyone who’s ever played the part. For one thing, she can actually act and sing...If you haven’t seen the show make sure you get tickets before word gets around that the show is just as good as it was this past year when it won the Tony for best musical revival or you will be paying even bigger bucks!...Honestly the best show on Broadway today."" ', '""\'Hello, Dolly!\' is much more than Midler—something only made clearer when seeing the show with Donna Murphy...Bopping around the stage with near childlike glee and determination, it was impossible not to be swept up in the wake of Dolly\'s addicting energy.

The entire company fired on all cylinders...One of the most exciting and satisfying experiences I\'ve had in a Broadway theater in years.""

I was moved beyond words.” ', '""Midler is in peak form as Dolly Gallagher Levi...It\'s a knockout performance that will be talked about for years...I could go on about this smashing, kick-ass revival.

Her vocals are pure and masterful...The production hasn\'t lost a step...Peters shimmering performance makes this wondrous production glitter even more brightly."" ', '""Midler eats up the wild applause as if it is food to her soul and gives back as good as she gets...Is her voice perfect for this music? No...but she gets the intent across in spades. If you want a beautiful voice, look no further than Baldwin’s hauntingly gorgeous tones...This show is in every way over-the-top broad, campy, kitschy and corny, taking it all to a new level, but the genius of this production is everyone is on the same page thanks to Jerry Zaks."" ', '""Here, in extraordinary circumstances – following the most celebrated star turn on Broadway in memory – Peters is utterly flawless...Under the expert comic direction of Jerry Zaks, she finds something to delight us in virtually every aspect of the role. She delights us, but moves us too...The silliest jokes seem to have blossomed into true wit; the musical numbers — from what is Jerry Herman’s finest score — have just as much, if not more, buoyant zest than they did when the show opened."" ', '“Jerry Zaks’ zingingly wonderful revival…For decades, Midler has known how to make the stage her own. She does so here…She makes every one of Jerry Herman’s cheerfully melodic tunes a tied-with-a-ribbon gift…Hyde Pierce bombasts beautifully…Baldwin is stunning and stately…Especially, and not to be forgotten, are the dancers and their tireless, athletic, work-like-play antics before, during and after the unforgettable title number.” ', '""The two-time Tony winner brings high spirits, warmth and a voice that will make you laugh and cry with joy...Victor Garber is gruff and blustering...Molly Griggs lends humor as straight-laced hat-shop girl Minnie Fae and London star Charlie Stemp lights up the stage with his bright smile and brilliant dancing feet as boyish clerk Barnaby...With the terrific current cast, wall-to-wall musical gems and ace dancing, design and direction, it remains a star vehicle that purrs."" ', '""Peters does more than full justice to the character of Dolly...Still oozing her particular kewpie-doll charm and singular sex appeal, Peters enchants...Can still trot out a strong yet flexible voice...Her comic brilliance is a bit of a surprise; she manages to find many very funny moments, even in places even Midler couldn\'t find them...Bernadette Peters is back where she belongs on the Great White Way, and giving the performance of a lifetime!"" ', '""Murphy is absolutely wonderful as the meddling, multitasking matchmaker...Murphy’s Dolly is gabby, game and gleeful as she dispenses the pleasures of Jerry Herman’s songs and Michael Stewart’s lines...Jerry Zaks’ production is better. The dancing of Warren Carlyle’s choreography is sharper and funnier. The sound is more crisp, the ensemble more assured and the accompanying stars perfectly aligned."" ', '“Midler brings all of her considerable talents to bear in this scintillating revival…Director Jerry Zaks, Midler, and a superb company breathe new life into the old gal. Zaks and choreographer Warren Carlyle give the show speed and youthful energy…Though her voice is limited, she brings reams of subtext to each number…Hyde-Pierce’s ultra-stuffy Horace Vandergelder is the perfect foil for Midler’s life-embracing Dolly…This joyous ‘Hello, Dolly!’ is a loving salute to a past tradition.” ', '""The production has made its own happy match with the show and its new lead — the vivacious, ethereal Peters, who has us in her palm the instant she lowers her newspaper in the opening scene...This is the theater magic we come to Broadway for, and it delivers right from the get-go...In an otherwise rollicking musical, Peters gives us a new, beautifully moving portrait of a well-known character, and it only takes a moment for us to fall in love with her and \'Dolly!\' all over again.""

Call Me Madam,"['""It would take quite a fabricator to wax excessively enthusiastic about the Crouse-Lindsay script...What \'Call Me Madam\' has in carloads is the Berlin score, undoubtedly tossed off in green-apple-quick time when—unlike today’s scores too often—melodic scores were expected and delivered...It could be said that \'Call Me Madam\' is a period piece.

But the holes are apparent...It’s the ministrations of choreographer Jones that most delight the crowd.""

And you didn't have to take out a loan or access a government program to afford tickets.” "", '""Sadly, Carmen Cusack doesn’t quite have the larger-than-life presence necessary to lift this flimsy star vehicle. She does, however, have a gorgeous voice and charm to spare, and these assets, along with Irving Berlin\'s terrific score and some deftly amusing supporting performances, make this \'Call Me Madam\' enjoyable if not spectacular...For every joke that falls flat, there\'s a terrific song.""

She has a down-home way of speaking that is ideal for the Oklahoma-born heiress; a warmth that makes it easy to see why the ultra-suave Cosmo Constantine (the velvet-voiced Davis) would fall in love with her; and a strong yet supple voice that lends itself beautifully to numbers.""

', '""Granted, the jukebox musical that opened on Broadway Monday night has some clumsy and dopey dialogue...Still, it’s thrilling watching the 72-year-old diva’s rags-to-riches-and-back-again life woven by wall-to-wall hits.

This is quite an easy assignment, especially since our three Chers provide a lot for the audience to love...It is certainly not a well-written musical, but it is an amazingly fun night of theater.""  ', '""It refuses to be beholden to anything you thought you needed from a musical. The result is equal parts exhilarating and mystifying, hilarious and stupefying, empowering and conflicting. Sounds like Cher to me...As nuts as the whole enterprise is, it goes so far into the absurd that it reinvents the theatrical rules that bio-musicals depend on...It knows what it is and it embraces it. If a musical can’t be high art, at least it can be low art with integrity."" ', '""The show whirls through six decades at a dizzying pace that disguises, up to a point, that it doesn’t have much to stand on...Cher’s actual hits can’t support that task: They are likeable but skimpy pop ditties. Elice’s script responds to this challenge by skipping past most of them quickly...Like Cher herself, the musical has the virtue of never seeming to take itself too seriously: It’s a delivery system for fabulousness, right up to its \'Mamma Mia!\'–like finale, and as such it succeeds.""

As one who has seen Cher in concert, it\'s almost eerie how well she delivers the star\'s no-nonsense patter,"" ', '""This is sensational actress-singer Block’s show as she turns in a rousing performance...Primarily a flashy expedition...There’s little depth to the book as it attempts to span developments in Cher’s life and career...The main attraction is pure glitz, the kind that sets off applauding by Cher enthusiasts...It is a sweeping jukebox bio with a chance to ooh and ah at the costumes and enjoy performance highlights in the triple-duty depictions of Cher...particularly the stint of Block as Cher."" ', '""Stephanie J. Block is flat out terrific...Also instrumental to the success of this show are unarguably Mackie’s fabulous costumes...Elice had the sense to pepper the piece with Cher’s caustic humor...I could scorn the clumsy, this book is about prologue and rhetorically ask when biopic musicals will learn that splitting a heroine into three nonlinear portrayals always gives us 2/3 less clear an idea of the person and over complicates history."" ', '""Obviously skilled in the craft of writing Broadway musicals about popular singers, Elice once again relies on narration and a chronological storyline, hitting on key events with a fine degree of humor and heart...Artistically, it\'s no match for \'Jersey Boys\'...Director Jason Moore does a fine job staging this complex show...We may have reached the saturation point with jukebox musicals, but for Cher fans eager to \'turn back time,\' the beat happily goes on.""

', '""If McPherson’s characters shall not be released from their suffering, the playwright allows them, and us, deliverance through Dylan’s music—gloriously arranged by Hale, whose orchestrations embrace Dylan’s roots while providing soulful showcases for singers...If Dylan recognized youth as fleeting, he also extolled its virtues with as much urgency as irony. His and McPherson’s shared ability to find beauty in longing alone make \'Girl From the North Country\' transporting and transcendent."" ', '""Conor McPherson’s radiant musical is as eccentric and unclassifiable as any fellow traveler of Dylan should be. A remarkable piece of theater, \'Girl\' opens tonight at the Public Theater with an impeccable cast...One of the best ensemble performances in recent memory...The Dylan songs – culled from his entire career to date and sung by the uniformly excellent cast – don’t so much unfold the narrative as convey mood and characters’ interiors"" ', '“A thing of beauty wrapped in sadness...A work of art that is engaging, insightful, and chillingly beautiful...A moving portrait of life...What is even more amazing is the way McPherson has integrated the music of Dylan into the stories of these troubled people...Each song is beautifully sung...This production has a unity and ethos in which every element seems to come together to paint a vivid picture of these people and their trials...A remarkable achievement...The cast is uniformly perfect.” ', '""A rich and strange marriage of the talents...If you’re a hard-core Dylan fan, you’ve heard these songs before. But, for me at least, they’ve never sounded quite so heartbreakingly personal and universal at the same time...The most imaginative and inspired use to date of a popular composer’s songbook in this blighted era of the jukebox musical...A uniformly excellent American cast that wears its roles like confining and prickly skins."" ', '""An extraordinary musical, unlike any currently playing in New York...Hunger rumbles off the stage in McPherson\'s urgently staged production, with earthy, emotionally raw performances from the entire cast...By incorporating its big, contemplative set pieces into a difficult, complicated story of American life, \'Girl From the North Country\' draws on the deeper traditions of opera and American folk music to create something that feels avant-garde by the current standards of Broadway."" ', ""“McPherson’s lovely, introspective drama that incorporates selections from the extraordinary songbook of...Bob Dylan...Performed quite beautifully by the wondrous ensemble...McPherson doesn't present a plot as much as a collage of encounters reflecting the kind of working class struggles Dylan wrote about. The songs don't come out of the dialogue but play more like unspoken spiritual cries...A thoughtful and compelling collaboration between two master storytellers.” "", '“A completely fresh and different kind of musical, that despite the bleakness of its setting and plot will send the audience out exhilarated...While most of the cast has straight drama as well as musical theater credentials, some who are best known in one area surprise us with the way they handle the other...McPherson has succeeded in creating a production that has Dylan\'s music beautifully and completely integrated into this portrait of of his home town during the Depression."" ', '""The marvelous aural effect created on the stage by writer-director Conor McPherson and 16 other cast members is of hardship and disappointment ennobled by the healing power of song...The voices of the playwright and songwriter coalesce harmoniously; they seem to be in conversation with each other...\'North Country\' is a breakthrough for the songbook form...If this wrenching gaggle of souls doesn’t migrate next to a home uptown, then it will be Broadway that is the poorer.""  ', '""One needn’t be a devotee of Bob Dylan to appreciate how the poetry of his song fits an Irish poetic vision of Depression-era America...Simon Hale has beautifully arranged and orchestrated Dylan’s songs for a band of four...The entire cast is excellent...In this haunting and beautiful \'Girl From the North Country,\' the Irish McPherson and Dylan, the American, illuminate the dream still alive.""    ', '""Utilizing Dylan’s inimitable songbook as the emotional core of the piece, the story floats out like a lyrical poem tinged with perfectly orchestrated music and songs...The smooth and gently soulful piece, filled to the brim with desperation and hopelessness, blends compassion with desire...The music wraps us in sadness and warmth, all at the same time, ushering us into and out of something so mystically beautiful, that it is almost too difficult to pin down.""  ', '""What makes \'Girl from the North Country\'…so special…is the showcase it provides for one magnificent cover after another of Dylan\'s oeuvre…thanks largely to the extraordinary orchestrations…Because of the show\'s position between a straight play and a musical, not everyone can avoid overacting...Dylan\'s lyrics often have little to do with the moments they illustrate…More significant than their specificity is their emotional value…Every song sounds freshly minted."" ', '""Bleak, enigmatic and haunting piece...In lesser hands, the show may have felt static or unduly depressing. But under McPherson’s focused direction, and with shaded performances from the cast, it proves to be unusually transfixing. Whether you call it a musical, a drama, or something else entirely, \'Girl from the North Country\' makes for remarkable theater."" ', ""“First among equals is Mare Winningham as Nick's mentally challenged wife Elizabeth. While her mind may not be all there, she is not so far gone that she is neither unaware of Nick's affair with Mrs. Nielsen (Jeanette Bayardelle) nor of the unhappiness of her children, the hard-drinking Gene (Colton Ryan) and the sullen, pregnant Marianne (Kimber Sprawl). Winningham is often very funny yet ultimately poignant, and her renditions of Dylan's best-known numbers are simply indelible.” "", '“Bleak and stunning...What truly makes \'Girl from the North Country\' take wing is the marriage of storytelling and music...There are a few holes in the story-telling, some strands that are left hanging, and what seems to be a misplaced upbeat coda intended to cut through the gloom. But between the performances, McPherson\'s direction, and the extraordinary music, ‘Girl from...’ is an undeniably magnificent theatrical work that reminds us why Dylan recently won the Nobel Prize."" ', '“If we just assembled to hear the many haunting songs by Dylan as sung by cast members...the experience would be enough of a treat. But McPherson pursued the idea of combining Dylan’s music and lyrics with a story to which they could be emotionally matched...It turns out to be a very creative fit that makes the musical extra fascinating...Here and there fitting a Dylan song into a situation may be slightly strained, but mostly the concept works exceedingly well."" ', '""Rather than artificially shoehorning songs into a purpose-built narrative, McPherson artfully builds a novelistic tapestry of archetypal figures, the poor and disenfranchised of an America suspended in time, using Dylan\'s pungently expressive lyrics...These people and their grim situations are carved out of a familiar Americana mold, and yet under McPherson\'s probing direction, the actors transcend melodramatic cliché, endowing their characters with battered humanity."" ', '""It\'s an unusual work in a stirring production that\'s bound to get under your skin...The work requires an emotional investment that\'s not easy at first. But thanks to Dylan\'s searing poetry, featured in some 20 songs, McPherson\'s brutally honest portraits and a talent pool that\'s miles deep, the humanity shines through warts and all...Every member of this large ensemble, including onstage musicians, is sublime."" ', '""Approached by Dylan to create a piece of theater using his music, McPherson has come up with a gripping play that defies categorization...With stunning new arrangements by Simon Hale, the music gives the play plenty to justify its hot-ticket status."" ', '""The show makes Dylan’s songs as unfamiliar as it can; it freezes them in timelessness...\'Girl from the North Country\' doesn’t have much plot, but it provides a compelling setting for Dylan’s plangent lyrics, whose range encompasses yearning, bitter confusion and grace. McPherson uses Dylan’s songs as atmosphere in the broadest sense: They are the air the characters breathe. And when the musical’s cool gains force, it acquires a piercing chill."" ', '""Powerful, ever-poetic Dylan songs have been exquisitely arranged as various solo, ensemble, and choral numbers by Simon Hale, the production’s music supervisor, and they are beautifully performed by a company of top-flight artists...The downside of \'Girl From the North Country\' is that McPherson’s saga is so heavily stacked with sorrows that the show threatens to become a thoroughly depressing event rather than a deeply poignant occasion."" ', '""\'Mysterious and dark...Like the folk songs that inspire Dylan\'s best work, the play blends human-scale drama with forces that lie outside the characters\' control...Isn\'t the onstage equivalent of an obvious Dylan masterpiece...it doesn\'t have that kind of precision or that kind of mass appeal...It makes emotional, if not always logical, sense...At times, it\'s weird, fascinating fun. At others, it brings Dylan\'s obsessions to life as vividly as the songs themselves.” ', '""The abundance of characters and the necessity to make room for songs limits the ability to develop any character in depth and rushes the exposition...Many of the plot threads seem overly familiar while others are abruptly dropped without resolution. The songs, while beautifully performed, rarely seemed closely linked to particular events or characters. While it was a pleasure to see so many fine actors on stage, I was sorry that they did not have more opportunity to act.""

The Lucky Ones,"['""The whole show is so beautifully crafted, it\'s less a musical and more a seamless experience that grabs you tight at the outset and never lets go until the final dimming of the lights. That\'s due in some part to a gorgeous script, but also in large measure to Tayeh\'s groundbreaking choreography, Bengson\'s warm stage presence, and a score that represents the best indie-folk/rock has to offer...Seamless, deep, and artistically inspiring, \'The Lucky Ones\' is theatre at its very best."" ', '""Abundantly surprising, deeply intimate, and simply gorgeous...It is raw, honest, and human. While scripted and certainly fictionalized at times, it feels anything but, due to the intensity of Abigail’s performance and the strength of Kauffman’s guiding hand...The show is expertly calibrated, energetically and passionately performed, and very moving. I must admit, I am smitten by The Bengsons and am eager to hear and see more of their unique voice and vision.""

It is a daring examination of the limits of memory and trauma.

I laughed, I cried, I jammed. I witnessed storytelling of intense emotional depth, and ultimately, the joy of storytelling.""

', '""The songwriting, though feelingful, does not yet seem complex enough structurally to handle the size and depth of the action it must portray...The music has a pleasantly droning quality that forestalls harmonic development. The ruminative, repetitive lyrics similarly stunt the drama...Kauffman’s astute staging does what it can to jury-rig a feeling of depth...The storytelling is as yet too impulsive, and at times too self-indulgent, to be corralled...A gawky, powerful work in progress."" ', '""By scripting former anguish and forcing themselves to relive the past for the length of an off-Broadway run, it turns the truth into something manufactured. Theatre is, by nature, false. Actors, playwrights, and directors are encouraged to be honest in their creations, but that’s not the same thing as being truthful...Abigail returns nightly to a brutal event from her youth...It’s either a brilliant performance or the memory is still so alive in her that the musical is functioning as therapy.""

Ghost Quartet,"[""for a previous production“Anybody within reach of Edinburgh should not miss out on this delight. The show is impossible to categorize. Is it a concept album played live, a musical, a theatrical performance or a concert? It is all of these and none…An intoxicating 70 minutes…A remarkable finale…The atmosphere may be dark but it is always playful and tuneful, aided by the presence of four fine musicians…It may not be easy to categorize but 'Ghost Quartet' should be on everyone’s must see/hear list.” "", 'for a previous production“A happily haunted song cycle…Directed with unobtrusive cunning by Tippe…On occasion the whimsy threatens to thicken to the clotting point. But the show never slows down enough to lose you, because Mr. Malloy is so infectiously in love with the dark arts of storytelling in all its forms…One of the most ingenious and affecting finales I’ve come across in years…Let’s just say that Mr. Malloy and company find new ways for guaranteeing that this exultant production’s melody lingers on.” ', 'for a previous production“Musically, Malloy reaches equally wide, his score an ingenious patchwork of folk, rock and jazz. But the best way to enjoy the show is to simply lose yourself in its otherworldly atmosphere, which easily goes from surreal to eerie, from touching to playful…Annie Tippe’s staging seems simple, but is actually ingenious…The finale is even better, one of the most wonderful staging coups of the season and too wonderful to be spoiled.” ', 'for a previous production“There’s not a linear story to follow, but the material coheres on a rich, intuitive level. Far less theatrical and character-based than Malloy’s ‘Great Comet of 1812’ this is an experiment in mood and evanescence, a chance to get inside the singer-songwriter’s head and savor the superb musicianship of his collaborators…They turn the Bushwick Starr into a cozy den of antique lamps and Persian rugs...Maybe like me, you’ll want to make it your regular haunt.”  ', 'for a previous production“‘Ghost Quartet’ is nothing if not complex. But in its tangled web lies deep, dark magic as many ghosts emerge into the light…The whole thing is almost literally entrancing, as you strain to catch meaning while simultaneously reveling in the sheer fertility of creation on offer. The performers are superb musicians and compelling performers. My only reservation was how much of the show took place in near darkness.” ', 'for a previous production""Dave Malloy’s ‘Ghost Quartet’ feels like a dream and a nightmare: overwhelmingly beautiful, complex, soulful and gripping.

The show brilliantly oscillates between musical genres, displaying an incredible variety of instruments and stunning vocal abilities...Absolutely lost for words.""

The story is enjoyable and the songs memorable.” ', ""for a previous production“A spellbinding song cycle-come-musical…The story feels summoned somewhere in the air between them, an electrifying presence, untethered to conventional blocking and choreography…As a narrative, however, it falls back on quite procedural motifs, and is difficult to piece together in the live setting, especially with so little staging. Whilst the whole is hard to assemble, 'Ghost Quartet' never loses its audience. Moment by moment, the vocals are full of mood and conviction.” "", 'for a previous production“The four musicians not only sing but play a dazzling range of instruments between them.

1776,"['""That Edwards’s songs are so secondary, and Stone’s book so good—certainly one of the best ever written for a musical—makes \'1776\' an unexpected choice for the Encores!...The sound from the orchestra is glorious and so is the production.

Stripped of period trappings its effectiveness is even more evident...Edwards’ clever lyrics and rousing melodies combined with the book have made \'1776 \'one of the most beloved shows by musical theater devotees and the public...Besides artfully integrating modernity into the piece with her fine concert adaptation of the original book, director Hynes has staged this presentation with vibrancy and precision.""

As John Adams and Ben Franklin, respectively, Santino Fontana and John Larroquette drive the show with the energy and chemistry of a comedy duo...Director Garry Hynes adds sly curveballs, like the casting of African-American Nikki Renée Daniels as Martha Jefferson. But what’s most striking is how powerfully \'1776\' argues for unity, honor and, yes, compromise—a resonant note in our divided times.""

Santino Fontana is unusually likable and photogenic as the \'obnoxious and disliked\' John Adams, but still captures the character’s fervor and fighting spirit."" ', '""There is no question that this is one musical where the book outshines the songs...This is not to disparage Sherman Edwards’ score, which is tuneful enough and does the show no harm; indeed, the songs provide much-needed breaks from the tension of the arguing, debating, and negotiating...Santino Fontana is terrific as John Adams...No one will claim that \'1776\' fails to play fast and loose with the details...Still and all, this is a fine production of a show.""

Edwards’ score is a terrific collection of melodies and styles, with his songs breaking up the action in a entertaining manner.""

', '""Garry Hynes’ supremely intelligent and entertaining revival of \'1776\'...shines as a sterling recreation of the struggles of the representatives of the original 13 colonies as they grappled with the question of American independence...Admittedly, \'1776\' is more a play with music than a traditional musical, with a mere dozen songs scattered throughout its nearly three hours. And only a few of them even stick in your head...The entire production benefits from a surplus of keen casting."" ', '""\'1776\' can sometimes feel like C-Span set to music...Your instinct is to yell down the corridors of history, \'Pick up the pace, guys!\' You may occasionally feel like shouting the same instructions at the cast members onstage...This cleanly mounted production begins with marvelous gusto...Mr. Fontana shoulders the responsibilities of a leading man with irresistible focus and passion…What was, and remains, revolutionary about ‘1776’ is that it dares to be as dull as real politics can often be."" ', '""Long-winded scenes without music are as enjoyable as taxation without representation. Stretches of the almost three-hour show are a slog. Still, Stone’s witty jokes about a do-nothing Congress never fail to hit the mark. Polarizing founding father John Adams does gags that could work for a Jimmy Fallon monologue...Set over three tempestuous and bloody months running up to July, 4, 1776, the show’s return is perfectly timed for current, high-stakes politics.""

With a witty book by Doug Wright, an excellent melodic score by Scott Frankel and Michael Korie, and deft direction by Michael Greif, they have created a highly entertaining musical.” ', '""The production becomes a spellbinding study in the competition of wills...Michael Greif’s production is a multi-layered, extraordinarily textured story...Written by a team of three gay men, the show is sometimes camp in tone – there are lots of stinging one-liners – but it is affecting and resonant about the pursuit of looks and love. Scott Frankel and Michael Korie\'s score has a series of soaring numbers of near operatic power for the women.""

Ebersole has never sounded sweeter...Wright’s dialogue is priceless.""

The \'War Paint\' book is also a marvel...Director Michael Greif not only juggles with aplomb these four lead characters and a featured one, but the Depression, World War II, the advent of TV, and the counterculture.

It’s well-packaged with some formidable ingredients."" ', '“Something the queers should flock to…The show is lavish and well designed…The two leads deliver, Ebersole emanating control and singing beautifully, knocking out her terrific 11 o’clock self-doubt number, ‘Pink.’ As Rubinstein, LuPone employs a thick accent, making her first song hard to decipher. She is also directed to overly lean on some of the joke lines she’s been given. But she’s in top vocal form, and when the two ladies are warring it up, this is gay heaven.” ', '""\'War Paint\' may not be this year\'s best musical, but it\'s a highly entertaining, inventive, and informative show...The substance seems solidly, sagaciously traditional. Lyricist Korie and composer Frankel rarely transcend the conventional show-music idiom, but they work fluently and intelligently within it, while Wright\'s pungent, pointed book skillfully encapsulates its many topics without ever running aground. Greif\'s direction pulls everything together with expectable smoothness."" ', '""Some of Broadway’s most solid craftsmen worked on \'War Paint,\' and it shows. Most of the team previously worked on \'Grey Gardens,\' and while this isn’t up to the caliber of that show, it’s still pretty darn good...The songs for Ebersole and LuPone go beyond intelligently painting the personalities of the two main characters – they are as exquisitely tailored for their talents...It’s very well-crafted, but not perfect...\'War Paint\' is smart and marvelously stylish entertainment."" ', '""Luckily, there’s not much plot to distract from these carefully nuanced characters, their amazing careers and dazzling wardrobes...The music feels right for both the individual characters and the progressive time frames. The lyrics suit the characters and serve the plot. And the book is smart and literate...While much is made of their fierce competitive practices, there’s little at stake here, aside from the loyalties of their male partners."" ', '""LuPone and Ebersole, giving performances of such resplendent force, wit and vivacity that the evening gleams like a freshly applied coat of nail polish...Enhanced by a sumptuous production directed by Greif...A nagging flaw in the show’s conception: the central narrative is largely undramatic, at times even superficial...When you have the opportunity to watch actors of this caliber, it’s easy to overlook many a superficial flaw, sit back and simply bask."" ', '""The musical is built around an unwieldy and repetitive Ping-Pong structure of shifting back and forth between the two characters...However, \'War Paint\' still has a lot going for it, including self-empowered protagonists, high-powered performances, well-crafted period-style songs, the classy aura of old-school New York and the smooth direction of Michael Greif."" ', '""The music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie work best when sung by the stars, and director Michael Greif has worked hard to keep up a pace in a show that seems over-extended...However, there is no getting away from the fact that watching LuPone and Ebersole is the main reason for seeing \'War Paint,\' and the stars who reign do not disappoint, even in a show with a strained book and less than glorious music."" ', '""Very classy and elegant new Broadway musical...Deceptively complex direction of Michael Greif...The show ultimately demurs when it comes to holding the great titans of makeup, and the men who surrounded them, to moral account. And that is what might just have made \'War Paint\' a truly great musical, instead of a highly entertaining and provocative one...A tad too admiring of its subjects for its own good."" ', '""Frankel\'s score sounds as though it were written just for them offering many showcase numbers (perhaps a few too many in the two-hour, 35-minute production) with soaring belts for the actresses to show off what they can do.

Disaster! A Musical,"['""A gleefully silly experience that doesn\'t purport to be anything but. Though the show does run a bit long and some of the jokes are belabored to the point of exhaustion, it works surprisingly well precisely because it doesn\'t take itself seriously even for a second...With a title like \'Disaster!\', Rudetsky and Plotnick are asking for it. But the mixture of a fabulous cast, winning self-effacement, and tunes we\'ve been grooving to for 40 years lead to a perfect storm of enjoyment."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' is a delightful musical that knows what it is and celebrates that with inexorable joy. It is smart enough to be an incisive parody of a film genre and still know how to be a successful parody of itself. It is difficult to imagine \'Disaster!\' without its remarkable cast. Not one star or ensemble member is expendable. This is an impressive, near miraculous accomplishment and one not to be missed."" ', '“The Broadway production is bigger, louder, funnier, and even better...Recast for the most part with a number of major league performers, this cartoon of a show is a perfect showcase for these interpreters of old-fashioned slapstick...The wonder of this show is that though the characters are archetypes they all also have dimensions that make us root for them…The score is comprised of classics that will undoubtedly bring smiles of recognition. What a delightful disaster this turned out to be.” ', '""\'Disaster!\' is the season\'s happiest, most charming surprise...This show lampoons everyone and everything in sight, and yet still makes us care about its lovable cast of off-the-wall characters. This is the best kind of campy comedy — the kind with a very big heart...\'Disaster!\' keeps spitballing one outlandish gag after another at the audience, a shocking number of which land."" ', '""The laughs literally don’t stop...I’m always a big fan and love anything that makes fun of itself in the process. There aren’t many serious moments in this piece. It is a kind of funny that you won’t find anywhere else, though some jokes may be considered hackney and overused, \'Disaster!\' doesn’t pretend they aren’t. In fact, \'Disaster!\' keeps very aware of that very notion throughout the piece...You truly need to be open to the silly and absurd to enjoy yourself."" ', ""“Put 'The Poseidon Adventure,' 'Earthquake' and 'Airplane!' in a blender; add 30 pop hits from the 1970s; stir in a seasoned cast of Broadway pros...This is the recipe for 'Disaster!', a lovably scrappy and often deliciously silly jukebox-musical spoof…Simard is divinely funny; she’s giving one of the funniest musical-comedy performances I’ve seen in years. Not every joke in 'Disaster!' lands, but there’s a lot to enjoy on this nostalgia trip.” "", '""The musical \'Disaster!\' is a campy carnival of cliches and gleefully cheesy comedy...The creative team has adroitly expanded the special effects and choreography to fill the Nederlander stage on Broadway. The book skillfully weaves a range of popular songs from the 1970s...Some character will always pop up with a new rescue idea, and there is high hilarity on these high seas."" ', '""When the willfully silly \'Disaster!\' is funny, it’s one of the funniest shows in town. Plus, you will simply not hear the 1970s disco and pop rock songs that make up its score sung better anywhere – in some cases they outshine the original...Plotnick’s direction is deft, dynamic and fluid, aided and abbeted by witty, driving work from choreographer JoAnn M. Hunter...\'Disaster\' is plenty of fun – at its best, close to comedy heaven – and recommended."" ', '""An outstanding ensemble cast...The laughs come not just from the increasing insanity of the plot, or from the over-the-top performances, but in the way Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick use their book to deliver unexpected twists on 1970s tunes...\'Disaster!\' zips along because the authors know when the joke is done and it’s time to move on, which allows the talented cast to shine even more brightly in the more extended bits of physical comedy."" ', '""Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick’s parody of ’70s disaster movies—set to carefully selected Top 40 pop and disco hits–turns out to be too much fun not to love...At first, \'Disaster!\' seems a little on the nose, and somewhat like a show that might actually be on a cruise ship. The choreography in the early scenes feels like it’s lifted from a bad ’70s variety show–it’s a little frantic. But once things settle down, the fun kicks in. And the second act just gets better, better, better."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' is a spoof of the 1970’s disaster movies and boasts a cast that can only be described as \'the best of the boulevard\'. \'Disaster!\' has a score of disco and pop hits, but I don’t think you can legitimately call this a musical. The songs are used as jokes, foreshadowed by a line so that you are expecting the song and elated when it shows up. None of the songs stay around long enough to wear thin. I laughed, I danced, I had a marvelous time. \'Disaster!\' is disco delight!"" ', '""\'Disaster!\' on Broadway is ridiculously entertaining...There is no need to extrapolate deep meaning from \'Disaster!\'. Could it be any sillier? Probably not, but honestly it doesn’t have to be. Everyone should just sit back and enjoy the wild ride; for us older folks, the disco music track to which this musical is set is a fab mood booster... Superbly curated hits from the ’70s cleverly edge the story along. Mix the zaniness with a terrific cast, and you have a highly entertaining evening."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' will provide a rush of giddy nostalgia that’s just as pleasurable, at times, as the more substantial rewards of the musical theater’s higher-reaching shows...\'Disaster!\' has such a sensational cast that musical lovers incognizant of the guilty pleasures of the movies being lampooned may still have plenty to savor...The first act tends toward waywardness, and while it runs just an hour, it feels longer...But the performances provide sufficient distraction."" ', '""The kooky material is given its best possible treatment by a seasoned cast displaying clockwork timing. A slew of Tony winners and nominees expertly plays a shipful of stereotypes... Is \'Disaster!\' the most brilliant musical in years? No. But it is a goofy, silly ride transforming the Nederlander into a joyful amusement park."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' is silly, and I mean that as a compliment...While the performances are really good, the placement of the songs isn\'t notably inspired...Most of the first act is preparation, some of it redundant, for the terror to come, and the comic capabilities of the talented cast aren\'t fully called upon until horror strikes...\'Disaster!\' isn\'t a show that\'ll get you to consider the meaning of life, but it compensates by being lots of fun."" ', '""You can have a swell time enjoying this unpretentious collection of bits and pieces of silliness...Jack Plotnick has directed and JoAnn M Hunter has choreographed a cast of 20, and they certainly keep things moving all evening long. It’s worth seeing...In the end, I had a jolly good time watching this stage full of talented folks letting loose and not worrying one bit about the 21st Century craziness going on outside the theatre."" ', '""While I wouldn’t call it groundbreaking, there is a guilty pleasure shaking up Broadway: \'Disaster!\', a new(ish) musical by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick...The high voltage cast delivers mostly hilarious performances and an array of familiar tunes assembled from the 1970s pop music songbook...The musical’s lack of original music occasionally feels contrived, though it’s fun to recognize the jukebox score...\'Disaster!\' doesn’t pretend to be anything more than what it is."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' totally isn\'t one. Sure, it could maybe be shorter by about fifteen minutes, and maybe a little sharper in spots, but I saw the third preview and it was already pretty damned funny…The whole cast is game--I am sure a sense of humor was a prerequisite for even getting an audition for this one…I also hope \'Disaster!\' finds a big, loyal audience, whether on Broadway or on tour…\'Disaster!\' is a silly, goofy, terrifically fun production."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' can best be described as a ridiculous disaster BUT has the best cast around and is so stupid you can’t help but laugh your head off. This show, about a cruise ship being attacked by an earthquake and a tidal wave, hits you with more sight gags, clichés and old songs than you can assimilate...If you want a night off from all the other serious Broadway shows, you will have yourself a ball sinking with this ship and its great cast."" ', '""The performances are so unapologetically silly and the production is so bright with flashing disco lights that ultimately you’re blinded to its flaws: humor that can miss the mark and campiness that’s sometimes a bit too overwrought...\'Disaster!\' is pure maximalism — a big, old-fashioned musical with big numbers and big performances. A lot of the fun is in recognizing the ’70s references, but even ’80s babies like me will be swept up in the show’s energy."" ', '""The musical delivers plenty of laughs spoofing ‘70s disaster films to a soundtrack of the era’s most recognizable hits. Its combo of nostalgia and cheap gags makes for a crowd-pleasing, if not exactly original recipe, and its ensemble of Broadway heavyweights, while capable of much more than they’re tasked with here, certainly seem to be having a blast...Plotnick juggles a lot of moving parts, though it may have taken an outsider’s perspective to make them add up to a more coherent whole."" ', '""\'Disaster!\' is a perfect storm of spoof. And, like all spoofs, it only works if you get onboard and stay onboard, even when the ship upends...The writers slipped in lots of big and small moments for nearly everyone...Bottom line–I had a good time. I knew the songs. I wore the clothes. I liked the silliness and the way, way overdrawn parodies. Cheesy? No question. Fun? Yep."" ', '""It\'s a recipe for theatrical cheesiness beyond compare and one that\'s served up with gusto by a spectacular array of Broadway talent...Anyone with even a passing familiarity with the genre at hand will anticipate most of what happens to these folks well before it takes place...\'Disaster!,\' thanks to the inestimable talents of the company, has steady enough theatrical sea-legs to provoke roars of laughter for those looking for a goofball night out."" ', '""Although not particularly glitzy or glam, this is a good cast that knows the comic ropes — and then some, in the special case of Jennifer Simard…The fun is contagious as long as we’re following these eccentric musical cues for plot and character development…At the helm, Plotnick manages the traffic well enough, and the actors are game, bless their hearts. But ultimately, \'70s disaster movies were far more ludicrous than anything on this stage.” ', '""As directed by Plotnick, \'Disaster!\' is intentionally cut from some pretty tacky cloth — a lot of it polyester, no doubt. So don’t plunk down your hard-earned bucks thinking you’re paying for \'The King and I.\' Or even \'Mamma Mia!\' for that matter. This slapstick diversion puts into the throats of its vocally accomplished cast of Broadway vets the sort of music that’s the subject of nostalgic TV pitches after 1 a.m...It is the caliber of these parodists that keeps the silliness afloat.""

Stew and Rodewald write songs that are the real thing and destined to be classics in their own right."" ', '""A mind-bending tale that grips you by the lapels from the first note...This production moves so swiftly that backstory is just not that important. Stew keeps our noses focused on the present, and that is such a circus we never look away...In spite of the fact that, once again, the direction has 90% of the action facing the center section of the audience, this is a spectacular production. Stew is a magician, and Rodewald is a brilliant partner for the road trip."" ', '""The newest great musical to launch at the Public Theater...A bit more ramshackle than \'Passing Strange,\' \'The Total Bent\' is no less thrilling...If you’re at all familiar with the Stew/Rodewald collaboration, you know it produces wildly pleasing music across pretty much every contemporary genre. \'The Total Bent\' is no exception and, as always, this one is just packed with heart."" ', '""A blazingly entertaining new musical...\'The Total Bent\' can get a little fuzzy when it comes to the details of its story. Stew’s book is not always cogent, although it’s consistently funny...Even if you may scratch your head at a few points, \'The Total Bent\' keeps you hooked through the surging power of its sensational score...At its best, \'The Total Bent\' feels more like an ecstatic combination of revival meeting and rock concert."" ', '“A fascinating piece of work, ‘The Total Bent’ unfortunately falls somewhat apart toward the end. Characters drop in and out of the narrative abruptly, without the chance to give the audience the sense of closure the situation calls for...The score, on the other hand, is simply amazing. The various tunes and styles—ranging from gospel to hard driving rock—perfectly capture the spirit of the show’s era, as well as the temperaments of the characters.""

This musical is an unapologetically honest portrayal of such heavy conflicts of race, gender, and politics in the most fun way."" ', '""\'Total Bent\' is a daring and overreaching sophomore musical…It’s a shaggy, idiosyncratic patchwork…Director Joanna Settle’s great achievement is crafting a physical production that looks like it sprang organically from a jam session…At close to two intermission-free hours it has its repetitive and dull stretches. However, the music is funky, fierce and sticky-sweet and you might get burned from the heat coming off the performers.""

But when the spitfire cast and outrageously phenomenal band burst into song, it's a religious experience of the highest caliber…A thrilling new score...Lyrically, the songs are sharp and often bitingly funny...At once messy and transportive, and thoroughly mesmerizing from start to finish.” "", '""I didn’t understand the ending, or else the creators and director Joanna Settle didn’t know where they wanted us to end up. Still, even without a clear destination, the intoxicating music with the sly lyrics, the take-no-prisoners performances and the laid-back hipster unpredictability make a heady journey...The new piece is part indie concert, part performance-art cabaret and a big part coming-of-age black-identity musical...Stew is a gifted, funny, sardonic lyricist."" ', '""Much of this show is about the music and the band - it seems the plot is secondary - with Stew leaving much up to your imagination to connect dots. It seems that it is really about ideas and themes rather than linear story...The concert-stage ready actors never fail to dazzle and blow the roof off the joint. I don\'t think this one is destined for Broadway given the holes in the storyline. But an enjoyable evening at the Public Theater is nothing to rattle your tambourine at."" ', '""\'The Total Bent\' is well worth seeing for its dynamic music, the star-making performance of Ato Blankson-Wood, who is filled to the brim with talent, and the great band. Everyone in this all-male cast is excellent. The production is  more staged concert than full production, which doesn\'t help the muddle of the ending. Stew\'s attempt at rhymed dialogue and his lyrics are best when they are taking a humorous view toward a very serious topic.""

The book..., though, is dross...The storytelling is vague and the characters more shadows than substance. But the performances...are all terrific, most extraordinary being newcomer Blankson-Woods."" ', '""Musically, it excels, but the surrounding narrative, which is at times awkward or chaotic, lacks the fine polish of the songs and performances. One of the show\'s strongest assets is its skillfully assembled cast...All of this gives \'The Total Bent\' plenty of substance to underlie its style, and all the more reason that clarifying the show\'s confusing aspects would be worthwhile...It\'s already a very strong piece, but there\'s still some fine-tuning to be done before \'Bent\' becomes total."" ', '""Director Joanna Settle keeps up the pace and holds things together as much as possible in this soulful, nonlinear, and humorously serious work. But the music-driven trajectory with scattered story fragments floating in and out seems more like separate bents than a total bent...Toward the end the convoluted narrative arc bends, and the musical becomes a rock concert. The music is so entertaining that you almost don’t care that the text is a bit of a rambling mess.""

The details of the plot may be vague and confusing. But every cast member sings wonderfully, the band is in top form, and the music provides all the momentum that the typical concert-goer (if not necessarily the typical theatergoer) would need."" ', '""The terrific Vondie Curtis Hall plays the seductively slithering gospel singing preacher and faith healer Papa Joe Roy...The story gets fuzzy in this one, which, after establishing its themes, evolves into more of a concert with a thin narrative. As directed by Joanna Settle, this keenly-performed premiere production displays the piece as an enjoyable work in progress with high potential."" ', '""Joanna Settle\'s direction keeps the show moving and brings out phenomenal performances but does not flesh out the show\'s story or meaning. It takes a village to build a show and Stew and Settle fail at telling a story that doesn’t leave the audience confused.

It is intoxicating and will draw you back despite the flaws in its structure.""

Fortunately, the rousing score — played by a terrific seven-piece onstage band including Stew and Rodewald — provides ample compensation for the befuddling storyline."" ', '""Stew and Heidi Rodewald’s new musical is sometimes thrilling. It’s also sometimes snoozy, without much to say — or at least to say clearly...At the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, sexually adventuresome Marty (Ato Blankson-Wood, magnetic) must break away from his gospel-singing father (Vondie Curtis-Hall, supercool) to make his own mark. That’s pretty much it. But when there’s music, \'Total Bent\' grooves with bluesy, funky urgency.""

But the plot becomes repetitious and feels drawn out at less than two hours.” ', '""It\'s a show with ambition and talent to spare, but also a frustratingly muddled story…The musical numbers by Stew and Rodewald move fluidly from gospel to James Brown-flavored funk to Prince-ified pop, and Blankson-Wood is a wonder…But the text by Stew lacks focus and refinement. The central conflict between Joe Roy and Marty is undercooked…There\'s a great musical buried somewhere inside \'The Total Bent,\' but it will take some further excavating to draw it out."" ', '""Blankson-Wood and Hall are dynamic performers, and they’re particularly powerful in the intimate performance space. But the generational conflict is only fitfully involving, in a production, directed by Joanna Settle, that tends to meander, and slows at the end despite the decibel level being ratcheted up. Ultimately, \'The Total Bent\' impresses with its cleverness while never quite becoming satisfying."" ', '""Somewhere around the halfway point, \'The Total Bent\' becomes little more than a song cycle...Joanna Settle\'s direction emphasizes the star\'s scintillating vocal performances, otherwise maintaining a tight pace that allows Stew to step in and out of the action in rapid-fire fashion...If only the text were more intelligible. Stew remains a gifted musician with something to say, but, as of now, he is still looking for a totally coherent way of saying it."" ', '""\'The Total Bent\' suffers from the limited dramatic abilities of its writers…There\'s nowhere unexpected for it to go or grow, and a cursory knowledge of recent American and musical history is enough to know how all this is likely to end up…No number stands out—and not in a good way. Though, to be fair, not in a bad way, either...This is exactly the kind of show that needs a galvanizing star performance to tie everything together. As it is, you get that only in limited quantities.""

Certainly it is compelling as a performance piece; the songs are mostly terrific, and are sung with immense panache and authority.

Sweet Charity,"['""Thanks to the cast (many playing multiple roles), and the visions of director Leigh Silverman and choreographer Joshua Bergasse, the show’s score comes wonderfully to life…Foster is brilliant as the title character. Not only in the comedic moments—Charity stops the action of an entire scene to make a sandwich—but also in the dramatic ones…Working on every level, this production of \'Sweet Charity\' is an absolute triumph."" ', ""“The real reason to see the new ‘Sweet Charity’, its third major New York revival, is for Sutton Foster's bravura performance. Aside from nightclub singer Reno Sweeney in ‘Anything Goes’, Foster has usually played innocent, clean-cut young women caught up in unusual situations. Here she again plays to type - but with a difference. … Under Leigh Silverman's direction, Foster may just be the most convincing actress to ever play Charity.” "", '""Unique, brilliantly cast, impeccably staged, and discovers the deep, rich underbelly of this musical that seems to have escaped notice until now...The musical peels away the layers of Charity’s past revealing her vulnerability and her less explored – but equally evident – inner strength...Under Leigh Silverman’s sharp direction, the members of the impressive cast deliver authentic performances animated with deep honesty and endearing charisma...Joshua Bergasse’s choreography is stunning."" ', '""This new version is the best production imaginable, and Foster is giving the performance of a lifetime in the title role. I’ve never seen her do anything better—and that’s really saying something...Emotionally convincing to the highest degree, starting with Foster’s performance...Since the other members of the cast are good enough not to be swamped by her, the result is not an unbalanced tour de force but a dramatically convincing presentation of a musical whose flaws can only be overcome."" ', '""The updated modern choreographic moves bring this \'Sweet Charity\' into the 21st century under the skillful hand of Joshua Bergasse, and the entire production melds and morphs with knowing aplomb under the extremely competent direction of Leigh Silverman. Sutton Foster comes off as an irresistible joy, singing, dancing and displaying her comic chops in her au natural, this-is-me persona. She proves, once again, she can do anything."" ', '""Foster, evoking some of the best comedy shtick of the era in the spirit of Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball, is brilliantly on point with her comedic timing…Bergasse’s choreography dutifully nods to Fosse on occasion, but also breathes new life into famous dance sequences. But the evening belongs to Sutton Foster, who puts her stamp on one of the great musical comedy roles of the 20th century."" ', '""Charity was always a pretty great part. And you’d be hard-pressed to find a performer better equipped than two-time Tony winner Sutton Foster, whose vocal and dance skills are matched only by her gift for physical comedy. The top-notch supporting cast includes Shuler Hensley; Asmeret Ghebremichael and Emily Padgett as two tell-it-like-it-is Fan-Dango dancers; and the versatile Joel Perez in four roles. Did we mention this production is stripped-down?"" ', '""My only complaint about the inimitable Sutton Foster is that I have a hard time figuring out what she does best. Flawless dancing? Check. Stunning singing? Yup. Hilarious physical comedy? For sure. But the thing that puts the cherry on the Foster cupcake is that while doing all that she manages to imbue every moment with a depth of character that most performers don’t attain even without the high kicks and tumbles…The performances are uniformly superb."" ', '""Joshua Bergasse’s sexy and stimulating choreography is the true star here–and rightly so. This is a reinvention rather than a revival–an exceptional and invigorating one...In Silverman’s hands, \'Sweet Charity\' is less a vehicle for a star and more a committed ensemble piece, albeit one where frequently there is a whiff of Fosse fragrance. Stylish fluidity is Silverman’s key to unlocking the musical\'s strengths...Enlivening this template, Sutton Foster is gloriously unbeatable as Charity."" ', '""In Leigh Silverman’s capable directorial hands, the excellent performances fill the space with the raw tensions of the story. Sutton Foster, no surprise, shines at the musical’s center…Foster is accompanied by a brilliant cast…Cy Coleman’s music lands laughs, aided and abetted by the skilled and hilarious choreography of Joshua Bergasse…\'Sweet Charity\' delivers with its hilarious and thought-provoking outlook on the life of its uniquely charming protagonist."" ', '""The largest achievement in The New Group’s revival (and it is a production brimming with achievements) is that the title character is somehow entirely believable…There is a seamless meld of actor and character that grabs the audience and does not let go…The singing is uniformly excellent…The production is smart and contemporary. If this ‘Sweet Charity’ has a life beyond its off-Broadway run, it will be a gift to the thousands of other people who will get to experience it."" ', '""This intimate mounting seamlessly welds comedy to tragedy with the help of one of the musical theater\'s great leading ladies, Sutton Foster...The production benefits from a stellar supporting cast...Everyone in the small ensemble takes on several parts with committed vigor...Not everyone will be pleased with some of Silverman\'s choices, especially musical purists...Still, Silverman strikes at the story\'s essence in this scaled-down revival starring a first-rate actress who really gets it."" ', '""Director Leigh Silverman absolutely nails it...It works beautifully and allows the top-notch evening of musical comedy that precedes to finish with a heartwarming glow...Simon\'s book is full of the kind of smart, urban wit that made his name a comedy genre...This is a \'Sweet Charity\' where the book gets a real workout. There\'s still the lively zest of sharply written musical comedy, but Silverman, Foster, Hensley and company make sure the fragile heart beneath the fun gets its say."" ', '""The musical is filled with priceless musical and dance numbers. One gem after another, ripe for stylized choreography and fun musical vocalizations...Both director Leigh Silverman and Bergasse have to find a way to satisfy our expectations and also place their own personal stamp on it. in general I think they succeed. Pretty well...The real excitement in this show is the dancing. And this is where the show flips back and forth from excellent to good...The show still shines bright regardless."" ', '""Smartly directed by Leigh Silverman, and designed with great ingenuity...Unsurprisingly, Foster brings her patented all-American optimism, to this difficult and iconic role...More importantly, Foster brings her equally flexible voice and legs to the often-bare stage, allowing her to perfectly land such beloved Cy Coleman-Dorothy Fields songs as well as brilliantly execute Joshua Bergasse’s complex, tap-and-ballet-inspired choreography."" ', '""This new \'Charity\' is built around an irrepressibly delectable Sutton Foster, who gives the show a refreshingly different flavor and thoroughly wins the day…This production of \'Charity\' has been conceived and staged not as a grand Fosse musical, but as a Neil Simon comedy. Which, in retrospect, it is....Georgia Stitt leads a ferocious all-girl ensemble, and they truly rock. Foster’s performance is by no means the sole attraction of this friendly \'Sweet Charity.\'"" ', '""Foster comes through with wrenching vulnerability as the forlorn dance hall hostess, but also adds an appealing ability to fight back to survive...Foster’s performance deserves to go beyond this limited off-Broadway run, and so does this production directed by Leigh Silverman and smartly choreographed by Joshua Bergasse...There are numerous striking numbers...\'Sweet Charity\' a hard ticket, but if you can manage to book it, you’ll have a very entertaining time."" ', '""Another career-making performance by Sutton Foster...Hensley knocks it out of the admittedly tiny ballpark...But that too is one of the things making this revival exceptional...These practiced bodies are all but in our faces much of the time, which has the odd effect of making the story that much more tough-minded without relinquishing its poignance...Foster\'s is a beautiful performance in a grown-up, revelatory revival."" ', '""Foster and Silverman bring comparable insight to \'Sweet Charity.\' They embrace the goofy, big-hearted openness of the title character, but also the bleakness of her reality...If the approach falls short of revelatory, that\'s perhaps because this flawed show can never seem complete without Fosse\'s dance moves…It could use a bit more oomph in the choreography. But the crucial component that requires zero improvements is Foster\'s gorgeous performance. She\'s perfection."" ', '""Purists may balk, but director Leigh Silverman and her star, Sutton Foster, have given us a whole new reason to fall for that dance hall charmer Charity…The proximity allows for a visceral experience up close and very personal. As Charity, Foster once again pulls out all the stops, confirming her place in the pantheon of musical theatre stars. She breaks your heart...Equally entertaining, it cuts deep with a poignantly resonant message of empowerment and, yes, hope."" ', '""Sutton Foster may well have been born to play Charity. Is there an actress more adept at toggling between hopefulness and heartbreak with just the bat of an eyelash? The New Group’s \'Sweet Charity\' is a bittersweet, but sublime revival…Leigh Silverman takes us through all the steps of the classic musical…\'Where Am I Going?\' closes \'Sweet Charity\' on a tender note that brought the company an ovation, and makes for a gut-wrenching reminder that this is no happy-go-lucky tuner."" ', '""As a pure reconstitution of a remarkable musical, it is a triumph...Silverman retains all that was wonderful about \'Sweet Charity\' as a heel-kicking, brassy musical. It is the grim reality of the present—that we are all about to be slammed back to those days, when misogyny was just the way it is—that gives the audience pause. That aside, there are no dead spots in this show...Foster is so good at everything."" ', '""They don\'t make them like Sutton Foster anymore. Her go-for-broke comedic skills make her a quadruple threat...It gets darker at the end, which can throw you for a bit of a loop. But the darkness adds pathos and poignancy, and, in this case, relevance...Mostly, though, this is a great excuse to see one of our living legends in an iconic role, and make it her own...Thankfully, this production and choreographer Joshua Bergasse takes full advantage of his multi-talented leading lady."" ', '""An energetic, playful revival...Director Leigh Silverman embraces the farcical schtick of the original, which mocked mainstream societal norms, and creates a vibrant sixties atmosphere while acknowledging dark moments...The production abounds with flashy, kinetic dance numbers courtesy of Joshua Bergasse, who maximizes Foster’s peppy appeal and athletic dance style."" ', '""It is absolutely a thrill to watch Foster up close…She’s winsome and utterly sincere as Charity expresses the happiness she feels at meeting one of her romantic silver screen idols…Leigh Silverman has assembled a large, ethnically diverse cast but even in a small space, the dance numbers don’t feel overstuffed or too busy…Although Simon’s book doesn’t entirely hold up, the show is improved by a stellar lead.

Preludes,"['""Writer’s block turns out to be a lot more inspiring than you could ever have imagined — and sad and stirring and gloriously fun.

', '""What makes \'Preludes\' such a marvelous show is the ingenious theatricality with which Malloy and his gifted collaborator, director Rachel Chavkin, chose to dramatize the inner workings of Rachmaninoff’s mind...But that’s only one of the arresting techniques...The coup de théâtre comes with the fateful performance of the Symphony No. 1 in D Minor."" ', '""Malloy’s playfulness is paired with a deep knowledge and love for his subject. The songs display Malloy’s conversational flair and his gift for aching melody. The show could have used more of that unfiltered emotion — it loses focus jumping back and forth, and sometimes gets just a little too clever. The one constant is Malloy’s talent, which, amazingly, isn’t crushed by Rachmaninoff’s long shadow."" ', '""Compelling? Yes. Entirely successful as a play, or as a musical whatnot? Not quite. But \'Preludes\' is an exciting experiment...\'Preludes\' earns a high recommendation. Surely, you\'re unlikely to see anything quite like it."" ', '""Anachronisms and malaprops abound, some of the humor is sophomoric and at a couple of points the whole thing comes perilously close to tweenosity. But in the end \'Preludes\' is an involving and ultimately moving story about the unknowable ebbs and flows of creativity that artists fear, sometimes master, sometimes fall victim to and invariably navigate over the course of a lifetime. As recreated here, it’s a most intriguing and engaging journey down the rabbit hole of artistic accomplishment."" ', '""I hated this show at first, but it slowly won me over, not to love, but to a respect for what it was doing...The unconventional style of some of Malloy\'s music doesn\'t move me, but it\'s partly my problem. Yet the second half of \'Preludes\' has some truly beautiful ballads...\'Preludes\' won me over. I\'m tempted to go again. It\'s unconventional, but fascinating."" ', '""The show is alternately enlightening and tiresome. Malloy and Chavkin find an intriguingly theatrical way to translate the experience of writer\'s block to the stage in all its arduous and disorienting glory...as \'Rach\' meanders through his raw past and stifled present, we the audience sink into his life\'s lulling monotony and our interest unfortunately begins to waver."" ', '""\'Preludes\' will please some and puzzle others...The problem is that its surreal premise grows thin and it all goes on too long. When Dahl and Rach aren\'t in the spotlight, it\'s sometimes difficult to pin down the supporting characters. Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov fade in and out of scenes rather quickly. And with the same actor playing them, it can get mighty confusing...\'Preludes\' hits some flat notes, but Malloy has reclaimed the salad days of this great composer without sentimentali...

And when the lights come up on all this noisy spectacle, what lingers in the mind is the composer’s deeply felt but simply stated wish: \'I would like to be re...

The same cannot easily be said of the other techniques Malloy and Chavkin employ, which veer more toward the haphazard and soulless...The roar of anticlimax is deafening. \'Preludes\' might run 80 or 90 ... ', '""A load of talent and resources has been thrown at this ambitious bio-drama, which features some rhapsodic music and glorious singing. However, the distancing show is too clever by half; it\'s dense, exhausting and pretentious...The creative team twists itself inside out trying to make artist\'s block theatrical and involving. But it can’t be done; at least not here...Nonetheless, the production looks and sounds terrific.""

Other than a busy, askew scenic design and some lighting effects, things are pretty prosaic...Another issue is that the stakes just don\'t seem very high. Rachmaninoff is frustrated but hardly devastated by his block."" ', '""Something of a gorgeous mess, \'Preludes\' is the latest music-theater work created by Dave Malloy...The trouble is that the story and the production rick-rack between their past, present, factual, fictional, comical and serious points so much that the proceedings are frequently confusing and wildly uneven in tone. Worse, some of Malloy’s contemporary compositions become terribly overblown...Overlong and certainly more overelaborate than it need be, \'Preludes\' is an extremely ambitious work th...

', '“If Ambrose’s turn as Eliza Dolittle was a revelation, Benanti’s is just as thrilling...Her elegance and sharp wit; her willingness to wax goofy, with the adroitness that only the smartest actors and comedians can manage; and of course, that glorious, silvery soprano...Benanti serves Shaw’s original vision, and his wit, with as much zest as her predecessor—and, it must be said, more palpable joy...The production retains the directional and design elements that made it both ravishing and wise.” ', '""Sher boldly cast two actors whose names are not instantly recognizable and who had not previously been seen in musicals...Sher’s gamble has paid off handsomely. In addition to her considerable acting chops, Ms. Ambrose turns out to have a lovely voice. Mr. Hadden-Patton is a fine actor who negotiates the transition between speaking and singing with great skill...It’s a near-perfect production of what many have called the perfect musical."" ', '""One of my immediate thoughts upon leaving Lincoln Center\'s Vivian Beaumont Theatre last spring, after seeing Sher\'s splendid revival of the 1956 musical ""My Fair Lady,"" was that great things come to those who wait. But now, I must amend that statement: Really great things come to those who wait.

And where has Lauren Ambrose been all this time?...So pure and powerful, she is a true star in a performance that will be talked about for years...I can\'t say enough about Sher\'s inspired re-imagining of the show. He put a subtle but indelibly relevant stamp on Lerner and Loewe\'s masterpiece.""

There are few words that could aptly describe this cast, but oh what a perfect cast it is."" ', '""Benanti can really sing and plays the perfect waif with a Cockney accent and chameleon persona.

', '""The show of course offers the same sumptuous design, lively choreography, and lush orchestrations. The performances of the original cast members who remain with the show have also deepened with detail...Benanti’s independent Eliza removes the question that I felt looming over this production of \'My Fair Lady\' when I saw it last April: Does the story still work if, as the director intends, we see no romantic feelings develop between Eliza and Henry Higgins? Yes, it still works."" ', '“I mean no disrespect to Ambrose, who originated the role in this revival, to say that Benanti is a more effortless vocalist; she dispatches her very difficult and wide-ranging songs with glee...The show is lighter as a result, which is not to say it’s less compelling...But it is the recasting of the smallest principal role that makes the most touching difference, and like everything connected to Harris’s stage presence, her success as Mrs. Higgins cannot be pinned down.” ', '""They haven\'t reinvented the wheel or excised anything potentially challenging. All they\'ve done, really, is own the material...May not be the best sung, but it\'s infused with genuine emotion from all parties involved...Where the production really shines is in the characters\' respective transformations...This \'My Fair Lady\' is a revival for the ages, the perfect synthesis of director\'s vision and performers and designers working completely in sync."" ', '""A beloved musical from another era can keep on kicking, and, as is the case here, it can even do so without making radical shifts in aesthetic, as long as it’s got its eyes wide open...This production team knows what they’re making and when they’re making it...Yeargan’s dynamic set, combined with Ambrose’s beautifully calibrated performance, always makes us feel as if events—educational and emotional—are rushing forward.""

A great revival of a great musical to end the season on a high note."" ', '""Sher\'s modus operandi is a deep appreciation and luxuriant refurbishing of a show\'s virtues with no great proclivity for reinterpretation, although in \'My Fair Lady\' he does give the ending a surprise twist...Shavian brilliance glitters throughout...with Lerner\'s book enacted to perfection by a cast headed by Hadden-Paton...and Ambrose...Sher\'s work gives the revival its own impressive sense of importance, with a series of breath-taking moments."" ', '""Sher excels at finding strong yet subtle resonance in classic musicals...What’s especially lovely is watching the tempestuous pair gradually fall in love...The production also looks and sounds great...Some might want to either lionize or lambast this as the #MeToo movement’s \'My Fair Lady.\' But at the end of its three hours, it’s these magnificent characters, not political issues, that will be dancing in your head all night."" ', '""It positively glows with class, in every sense, shimmering with confidence and oozing with delight...Hadden-Paton brings a nicely youthful yet appropriately flummoxed air to the role, and in what appears to be his first musical, carries the songs with conviction, too. He is ideally partnered by the earthy, gritty honesty of Lauren Ambrose’s Eliza...There is luxury casting all around them."" ', '""Shaw was always on Eliza\'s side, and with Sher\'s brilliant directorial decisions, the bullies and dolts are left in the melodic dust...Ambrose is a delightful Eliza; she has a soaring voice, and she provides flawless accents in a plot that\'s about accents...Hadden-Paton is a superb and witty bully...The huge cast is full of great voices and impeccable diction; their timing, especially in the wondrous \'Ascot Gavotte,\' is hilarious perfection."" ', '""Ambrose not only has the voice for Eliza Doolittle...but she also demonstrates how a masterful actor can bring new dimensions to a role that makes an entire revival a new experience...This production is quite traditional but very stylish...In the end, it is Laura Ambrose\'s Eliza Doolittle that makes this revival special. All of the elements that Ms. Ambrose exploits are in the book and lyrics; but she brings unique insight and deeply felt emotion in expressing them."" ', '""Sher\'s lush, elegant revival of \'My Fair Lady\' has been triumphantly successful...Feels as contemporary as ever, its characters like they may have been written yesterday...A carefully, cleverly selected cast has given life to this classic...Ambrose gives a masterclass in leading-lady grace...She is everything posterity needed to thank this production...Hadden-Paton plays a first-rate Higgins...What shines in his performance is a comic sensibility that relegates Higgins to absurdity."" ', '""A straightforward and first class production of one of Broadway\'s most beloved musicals with a little widening of actor\'s ethnicity for inclusions sake. And while neither Ambrose...nor Hadden-Paton...are a Julie Andrews or a Rex Harrison, they are more than adequate in their roles...This is a full 30 piece orchestra and the music shows no strain being compared by the great orchestras of the past: no corners are cut and the sound is terrific.

The songwriters have a feel for the period but their numbers are pale compared to the colorful popular tunes of that era.” "", '“Oberacker and Taylor’s score, with punches of contemporary rhythms, is fierce and athletic, reminiscent of ’40s swing…Cott and Osnes, both attractive performers, are also both expressive singers and define their characters, and their slowly growing romance, with nuance...This is an intense story, yet uplifted by high-flying energetic song and dance, humor, strong performers, and the life-affirming promise of music.” ', '""The joy of experiencing \'Bandstand\' is seeing an original musical...The subject matter is familiar but still relevant today...The book seems contrived and you can see how things are going to fall in place.

Among the swing music, vitality, sound, Ms. Osnes and Mr. Cott, it is an evening of sheer delight.""

So, too, is director Pamela Hunt…All in all a terrific representation of the Herman songbook. Recommended.”  "", '“A joyous and infectious tribute to a song catalog that made Broadway sing…These melodies remind us of a time when theatre gave us lush ballads and up-tempos that lasted more than the show.

While not everything gleams in this jewel box of a revue, it is worth sampling the treasures anew.” ', '""With a few exceptions, director Pamela Hunt does little to celebrate Herman’s songbook.

Much of the credit goes to the two performers, Wade McCollum and Valerie Vigoda, who is also the lyricist and plays a mean electric violin...The sentimental, self-help aspects of \'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\' don’t get in the way of what is so enjoyable about the show. The most delightful aspect of \'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\' are the lively musical numbers."" ', '""A production that has Peterson maximizing its many strengths. The musical is so original that many spectators might sit through it with jaws dropped. That’s when they’re not cheering its high entertainment quotient...To give the impression Kat’s satisfied with having had the imagined Shackleton affair is pushing whimsy too far. That doesn’t do it for a woman with this amount of indomitable spirit...\'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\' still comes across as absolutely original. It’s a welcome rarity.""

McCollum, with a twinkle and grin, blessed with a rich voice and good acting chops, should go on to be theater’s next new leading man while Vigoda is a genius electric violinist and actor.

It should not work, but does and beautifully...A musical that doesn\'t take itself too seriously...Done with clever production design...Vigoda, who is sweet and badass as Kat, is at her best playing music and singing. Still, she has great chemistry with Shackleton. McCollum is a blizzard onto himself—he storms over the stage as Shackleton... Absolutely worth a trip upstairs to discover it."" ', '""There is little by way of set design beyond the large video installation and a few props, but imagination and the energetic performances take care of the rest. Musically, the show is filled with thumping songs ranging from pop tunes to sea chanteys to soaring power ballads...Corny, perhaps, but the performances are so splendid, that you will find it hard to resist all of the positive energy that pours off the fine co-stars."" ', '""Thanks to the expertise of its inventive makers and performers, ‘Ernest Shackleton Loves Me’ proves an enjoyable bite-size epic, zipping along on a good-humored script, a lively, melodic score, and direction from Lisa Peterson...Vigoda invests Kat with a winning energy, and McCollum, an especially fine vocalist, cuts a charismatic figure as the courageous Shackleton. Together, their blazing performances melt away any doubts about the show’s potentially dubious concept.” ', '""Under the direction of Peterson, this NY premiere proudly waves its freak flag, and, perhaps taking a clue from the adventures of the title character, boldly dares to risk its life in the admirable search for innovation...While Vigoda and McCollum don\'t have much romantic chemistry, they\'re both delightfully quirky performers who really know how to sell the material...Peterson\'s direction guides them both into larger-than-life performances that, remarkably, are down-to-earth at the same time.""

And special kudos must go to designer Nichols, whose video projections make smart use of the historic footage from the real expedition...The show is silly, with most of the humor supplied by the talented Wade McCollum...At heart, \'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\' is an old-fashioned inspirational tale about having the courage to endure, be it subzero temperatures or a 3 a.m. feeding."" ', '""The engaging and original comic musical is definitely a respite from some of the recent substandard adaptations of popular films and books littering the theatrical landscape...DiPietro’s book is quite witty, with a wonderful pro-feminist message, the score by Vigoda and Milburn is smart and tuneful...And yet, the show’s 90 minutes just don’t fly by as fast as might be expected...The show’s premise is still a bit of thin ice, no matter how well the super-talented McCollum and skate on it!""  ', '""Though DiPietro’s Book periodically suffers from trying too hard to be funny, most writing knits in well...Music and lyrics are of wildly different quality...Actors Vigoda and McCollum are both fine musicians and strong vocalists...Director Lisa Peterson skillfully leads us from Brooklyn to the Antarctic and back...Music is nicely integrated. Danger is adeptly conjured...\'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\' sometimes challenges patience, but taking the ride is not without rewards."" ', '""What sells it is the unrelenting charisma of McCollum combined with Vigoda\'s impressive musicianship. McCollum switches easily between several characters...Has its share of exhilarating moments, but starts to run out of steam in the latter part of the show...It\'s a show that may at times be a bit too zany for its own good, but it charms thanks to its incredibly appealing performers and its thoughtful design...Sure to resonate with audiences in need of a good pick-me-up."" ', '""Under Peterson\'s canny direction, this bizarre premise is so smoothly put over that there are many things to enjoy...The exchanges between a frazzled twenty-first century woman and her Edwardian explorer are often amusing...The idea of using this historical event as a way of working out Kat\'s personal problems is so weirdly random that often one\'s mind wanders...A confident production with many crowd-pleasing aspects, but it is built on a questionable concept."" ', '""A bighearted but very silly musical...Brendan Milburn’s music is lovely, and the two actors sound great performing it...The painfully broad humor in Joe DiPietro’s script only heightens the feeling that we’re watching an after-school special for grown-ups. But \'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\' is so clearly a labor of love that it’s hard to be too bothered by the cartoonishness, even as the show sails into shallow waters."" ', '""Vigoda and Milburn\'s works mix the snarky and the sentimental. Under Lisa Peterson’s focused direction, \'Ernest Shackleton\' is no exception...With the exception of a cheerily disjointed opening number, the score and the narrative that encases it are too tidy to allow for much real feeling. Kat is supposedly an experimental composer, but most of the music is merry pastiche...If Mr. DiPietro’s premise is nicely weird, his psychology and story rarely buck convention."" ', ""“Chelsea Cook's costumes are completely realistic, but Nichols' physical set with its scaffolding and onstage equipment never lets us forget that we are in a theater, not on an adventure since his lighting never blocks anything out. Lisa Peterson's direction is smooth but she is unable to turn the show into something that it isn't. ‘Ernest Shackleton Loves Me’ requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief but may charm those who easily succumb to whimsy.” "", '""Quirky is the word that comes to mind...Ernest Shackleton (Wade McCollum) is a real-life explorer who went to Antarctica. An odd choice for leading man. However the leading lady (Valerie Vigoda) can strum the electric violin like nobody\'s business while she\'s going along on her excursion with Ernest. Quirky-they fall in love. Quirky-it\'s just weird, silly, a bit absurd, but at least it was quick."" ', '“Vigoda turns in an inspired, heartfelt performance and impressively plays the electric violin…The strapping, likable Wade McCollum plays the boyfriend and the banjo-playing Shackelton and nails both roles…Smartly staged by director Lisa Peterson, images are projected on a large screen, largely featuring Shackelton’s explorations, which lend a dose of drama and realism...There are amusing moments, but the musical ultimately grows thin and frigid.” ', '""As someone who was deeply moved by the story of Shackleton and the brave crew of the Endurance, I was distressed to see this story misappropriated for so frivolous a purpose. To project film clips and stills from their expedition to prop up this silly show is almost a desecration. Perhaps a younger audience unfamiliar with his story and with a taste for electronic music will find the show more congenial. I found it a pointless waste of time.""

Yet I can’t shake the feeling that this really is more of a project than a show. Of course, there is still plenty to enjoy and take to heart.""

', '""The first act took a while to recover, with lagging pace and loose staging...Once the second act got underway, I realized that act one needs to be fragmented, the people need to be irritating, for the second act to be as powerful as it is...The revival cast is nearly flawless, each member showing more nuance and complexity even than in their most recent stage roles...Lapine has found an even more powerful way to bring the show to a close."" ', '""Lapine serves as director for the terrific new Broadway revival of \'Falsettos\' that, through more lyric revisions and interpretations that provide a greater unity of tone, finally fuse the two acts into a singular piece of romance, wit, jaunty melodies and realistic characters trying to keep their neuroses in check...Lapine\'s new cast takes \'Falsettos\' in intriguing new directions."" ', '""A heartbreaking revival...It’s hard to get through the last half hour intact...If this Lincoln Center Theater production, directed by Lapine, has any serious faults, they arise from that agenda. As written, Marvin is so nasty and erratic in the first act ...Christian Borle can’t resolve that contradiction and thus comes off a bit unsteady, at least until he regains his footing in the second act. The other principals, whose roles are more tightly written, are excellent throughout."" ', '""\'Falsettos\' shines just as brightly in 2016. It takes the mark of a score that weaves its ways into your soul, a book that knows how to speak with honesty and a director who allows the show to live on its own merits to do that...The one thing that bothered me were the orchestrations and the slowing down of the original tempos...Finn’s score sticks to your soul like embedded thorns of wisdom. Lapine’s direction takes on a new dimension...If you want to be moved, this is the show to see."" ', '""This surprisingly fresh revival has been directed by original director Lapine, who plainly understands the bittersweet humor and provisional joy of that period...The warm performances of a terrific cast soften the underlying sadness of Finn’s breakthrough musical...The story is largely told through the easygoing score, a fusion of tuneful melodies with insightful lyrics...Borle’s neurotic hero is well matched with Rannells’ Whizzer."" ', '""Few musicals have the range, idiosyncrasy and emotional punch of this profoundly unconventional and personal work...As enjoyable as the snaggletoothed and biting first half can be, it hardly prepares you for the extraordinary second...Finn pushes musical theater to the limits of what we can ask of it. Those who know the show may find fault with some of the revival’s choices...But flaws are written into \'Falsettos,\' as is the impulse it elicits to forgive them."" ', '""How does \'Falsettos\' look nearly 25 years on? Just great—with only the merest reservations that certainly don\'t have anything to do with the several brilliant Finn songs...Today its impact has shifted. It\'s an unflinching look back. Nevertheless, as it plays, it retains emotional pangs...Last but hardly least in this wholly sincere recommendation are the cast members who understand the Finn and Lapine paean to humanity and bring it movingly to the stage."" ', '""Life is messy — as everybody knows...That includes creators William Finn and James Lapine. They don’t sugarcoat reality when it comes to love, sexuality and relationships...That clear-eyed take has always been — and still is — an intriguing strength of \'Falsettos\'...Finn’s alternately lighthearted and poignant score in this mostly sung-through show is another major asset...Plan on being deeply touched and richly satisfied at this show."" ', '""The show remains brave and hilarious, a charming and deeply moving treasure...That first half feels very sweet but a little naive these days, somewhat of a period piece without all the rich sadness and lyric maturity of what comes later. But then...bam!...Although it’s hard to separate these characters from the original actors, the cast is terrific...Lapine’s direction is finely calibrated to be showy without being show-bizzy."" ', '""Features a crackerjack cast and creative team...The music sounds better than ever and the nerve centers of AIDS-discrimination and the meaning of family are still rich...The songs, a fanciful and frenetic, largely sung-through mix, drive the story and explore the characters with insightful lyrics...Lapine keeps the story moving forward, but the music sometimes feels repetitive and the ending is somewhat abrupt, yet it still delivers its poignant punch."" ', '""The warm and moving ‘Falsettos’ is back in a Lapine-directed production that serves it with respect and class…Block delivers, especially in a powerhouse \'Trina’s Song\' about breaking down, Rannells is cutely charismatic and touching, Uranowitz is wryly funny, and Borle gets to show a quieter side to his talent than usual. Thoms and Wolfe are also superb. It’s more like a \'really nice\' than a transformative \'OMG,\' but still, all these years later, \'Falsettos\' still deserves high-pitched praise.""

A Taste of Things to Come,"['""Documenting the influential and crucial decade between the \'50\'s and \'60\'s, Debra Barsha and Hollye Levin\'s new musical \'A Taste of Things to Come\' is a very pointed yet enjoyable exploration of these transformative years for the housewife, told through the eyes of four women who have a common interest in cooking.""

That said, as helmed and choreographed by Lorin Latarro and performed by the sparkling talent, it offers an enjoyable holiday diversion.""

None are especially profound, and nostalgia trips to the 1950s and ’60s have been so numerous in recent years that a lot of what’s here seems tired and perfunctory. But the energetic performances, directed and choreographed by Lorin Latarro, are something to savor, and so are the harmonies.""

It is the story of a stupid war told with humor and fun, but the correct amount of compassion...Pailet puts his energetic cast through a non-stop emotional ride, and the audience follows with gusto.""

Shields’ choreography is sharp and inventive, and musically the show soars.""

', '""\'Baghdaddy’s\' humor is based in the irony of horrific truth, but the musical’s message is as important and informative as it is entertaining...All of the actors here are uniquely exceptional...Marshall Pailet’s direction is on point and clever, though some of his book is a bit too metaphorical and quick for audiences to deftly appreciate. However, the music is catchy, so the book is mostly forgiven.""

The laugh-out-loud lyrics by Penedo certainly will rattle around your brain long after the final bow...‘Baghdaddy’ is compelling, clever and based on a true story.""

Penedo are often clever, and the book by both of them is almost consistently lively. The choreography by Misha Shields adds fun…My only quibble is that it could benefit from a slight trim. The play is certainly timely as the prospect of getting into a war by accident seems all too real.” ', '""A good show with a bad name...This magnificently rehearsed and talented cast adds energy, enthusiasm, heart, and soul to the script...The play suffers split personality...It\'s a bit all over the map but gets the point across.

At its worst, it is sketch comedy, albeit with free donuts and coffee for the audience…Trimming the title was a good idea. Decluttering some of the on-stage action would have been an even better one.” ', '""One of the crucial issues with \'Baghdaddy\' is the tone...It is nearly impossible to address the darkness and gravity of the Iraq War when your actors are bouncing off the ceilings...The actors all give committed performances, but there is very little space for complex characters...I kept searching for unity in the music and book to explain why this story is a musical, I never found it...Whenever the show seems to gain steam...the action veers back towards a song that is simply a distraction.""

They have dared to do away with spectacle and in doing so, have allowed this important story to come to life with engaging brilliance.""

Not a single moment goes to waste throughout the production, and there’s plenty to keep your eyes busy with deceptively elaborate choreography and set design."" ', 'for a previous production""Who\'s Your Baghdaddy? is anything but your run of the mill musical comedy. It is clever in its construction, rarely whimsical, performed with an honesty that grants each character dignity, and spellbindingly intellectual. Certainly dramatizing the events leading up to September 11, 2001 and the storm that followed in a musical fashion is a risk, but it\'s a risk well taken and exceptionally executed.""

But in the end, this is a show that you should expect to see in larger (and pricier) venues very soon.""

', 'for a previous production""This high-energy production is graced with a multi-talented cast who reveal the characters involved in the catastrophe, singing and dancing their hearts out.

Go see \'Who’s Your Baghdaddy?\' It is totally unique."" ', 'for a previous production""\'Watching Who’s Your Baghdaddy?\'  is both entertaining and enraging. Like any fine satire, it is smart and savvy and does a terrific job at reflecting our own inadequacies and failures. It is maddening, however, when we stop to think why this true to life theater piece had to be created... Pailet and Penedo appear to be relative newcomers to the New York musical theater scene, but for the sake of quality , let’s hope they keep creating work of this caliber.""

', '""As impressive as their believable characterizations and extraordinary vocal talents is the cast’s dazzling execution of Trujillo’s killer choreography...Enhanced by an artistic design that is at once dazzling and refined...A stellar production that elevates the quality of jukebox musicals with its engaging story and direction, top-notch performances, sophisticated design, and a selection of high-voltage choreographed hits that keeps the legacy of Motown alive.""  ', '“The magic, history, poignance and joy displayed by the production company creatives of ‘Ain’t Too Proud’, are bar none. The show is one of the best on Broadway...Special accolades go to McAnuff for his seminal direction and staging...But the rising glory must land on the actors and ensemble responsible for the breathtaking portrayals of the ‘Classic 5 Temptations’...By the conclusion of ‘Ain’t Too Proud’, I felt like I had spent time with loving family who passed...Must-see.” ', '“A brilliantly-tooled entertainment, bursting with explosive onstage talent, fortified with Olympian stamina...You don’t have to be a dyed-in-the-wool Temptations fan to want to start gyrating in your seat...While it never quite escapes the feeling that we’re being...fed a checklist of narrative points, it’s a fairly compelling story...McAnuff’s staging is masterful...The numbers exponentially heighten the excitement with great singing and Trujillo’s choreography.” ', '""This jukebox musical not only has life, it also has wit, intelligence, while also looking stunning and full of energy...It’s as funny, revealing and moving as it is hummable and toe-tapping...Music is the route to personal salvation as well as fame and success, with Morisseau excellent at elevating detail amid the grand sweep...Instead of telling these storylines in an overwrought style, or even telling them at length, Morisseau and McAnuff figure out a lean, clever middle way."" ', '“From the very first moment...it is impossible not to be completely engaged...’Ain’t Too Proud’ isn’t just another jukebox musical...It is the story of R&B music and its rise on the American music scene. As exemplified by The Temptations, there is absolutely nothing more compelling than that tale...Morisseau has woven the narrative with the music brilliantly. And McAnuff keeps the excitement going at a steady clip...The real star of the show is the music of The Temptations.” ', '""Buoyed by the suave choreography of Sergio Trujillo and thrill-a-minute performances by such stars-in-the-making as Jeremy Pope and Ephraim Sykes, \'Ain’t Too Proud\' proves to be two or three cuts above the standard-issue anthology pop musical...The propulsive narrative of \'Ain’t Too Proud\' not only reflects Morriseau’s understanding of how to invest an audience in the Temptations’ emotional spirals, but also McAnuff’s savvy at packing the music into every available nook and cranny.""  ', '""The most electrifying show on Broadway...The general pacing of the show is quick and seamless...Each actor completes the enactment of the classic Temptations, but the female voices command the stage, even if for a short moment...Their exits, symbolizing each respective death, leaves the greatest imprint on the heart, showing how meaningful the lives and artistry of The Temptations was to humanity."" ', '""Shrewd direction of Des McAnuff, with sensational choreography by Sergio Trujillo...While honoring all the expected biomusical clichés, which include rolling out its subjects’ greatest hits in brisk and sometimes too fragmented succession, this production refreshingly emphasizes the improbable triumph of rough, combustible parts assembled into glistening smoothness...As for the performance of those songs...they’re pretty close to perfection."" ', '“This jukebox musical is a cut above the rest. What suffers here is the book by Morriseau that seems more like a memory play of Otis Williams, than engaging scenes that draw us into the action...If you love the music of The Temptations, amazing singing, smooth dancing, a show light on book, then you will adore the electrifying ‘Ain’t Too Proud’...There is never a dull moment in this show.” ', '""Carves out its own unique place in the genre, most especially when it’s up on its feet singing and dancing...Thankfully, Director Des McAnuff put the songs front and center, bringing out the best in his outrageously talented company...\'Ain’t Too Proud\' ranks pretty high as jukebox musicals go. Not only is it vastly entertaining, it reminds us how the best of Motown was able to prove that music could be colorblind even if the rest of the world wasn’t.""  ', '""Morrisseau ‘s timeline is fuzzy, and while there is the feeling of a sketchy paint-by-numbers, \'and then we did,\' in the narration, the music lifts and soars over the enormous theater...All the dancers in \'Ain’t Too Proud\' are outstanding, but it is undeniably the lead, Ephraim Sykes, trained by Alvin Ailey, who delivers the money moves, laser-sharp steps, and breathtaking leaps.""  ', '""Morisseau sticks close to the source, and as the action propels forward, one can understand Williams’ decades-long struggle to keep five big personalities in the spotlight...Deftly navigates between the personal and the public under McAnuff’s swift guidance...\'Ain’t Too Proud\' spoonfeeds its soul food, and audiences will eat it up...For those who can snag a ticket to \'Ain’t Too Proud\' while its original Broadway company remains intact, you’re in for something wholly spectacular."" ', '""Two and half hour of pure pleasure, a thrilling non-stop ride through R&B pop music and an exuberant celebration of the American jukebox musical in its matured form.  It’s the best since \'Jersey Boys\'...Morisseau doesn’t try to make The Temptations’ story any more than it is, because \'Ain\'t Too Proud\' is all about song and dance...Most remarkable is that not only do the actors as a group soar but also each actor imbues his character with his own set of moves and vocal style.""  ', '""What makes \'Beg\' memorable is the sheer overwhelming talent of the cast. Even if no one character has enough time or space in the script to fill in the contours of a full personality beyond a few fast details they can still bring every sweet harmony and cross-step...It’s hard to feel the real impact of those losses in a show that has to cover so much ground...But it’s also hard to remember a closing as joyful as the one \'Beg\' builds to."" ', '""A sprawling, by-the-numbers musical journey…Its biographical and dramatic values are far less compelling-because they so closely fit a familiar pattern-than the rousingly entertaining ones of the music…There\'s nothing very new here in terms of celebrity fame, fortune, and fatality but the show packs its biographical ups and downs into a neatly packaged, exceptionally well-staged and performed sequence of scenes that incorporate both original Temptations songs and covers."" ', '""Musically, however, the show is on much surer footing. One cannot underestimate the invaluable contributions of the other men playing the so-called \'classic five\': the electrifying Sykes as the egotistical if supremely talented singer David Ruffin; the extremely charismatic and angelic-voiced Pope as the strong-willed Eddie Kendricks; the fleet-footed and intensely likeable Harkness as Paul Williams; and the endearing Jawan M. Jackson as the usually agreeable Melvin Fredericks."" ', '""As jukebox musicals go this is one of the stronger ones...Act I follows the more typical jukebox musical pattern by throwing out a lot of exposition...But things balance out much better in Act II...Here is where \'Ain\'t Too Proud\' stands out from other jukebox musicals, by bringing to life the individual members of a five-person group and by allowing us to follow their ups and downs, even if by necessity, their stories are condensed to fit the form."" ', '""Sure, there are craft issues with a show that\'s more narrated than dramatized...But as a fan experience, this high-energy tribute delivers big time...Propulsively directed by bio-musical specialist Des McAnuff...The briskly paced production frequently generates the excitement of a terrific concert...Even if Morisseau doesn\'t dodge showbiz clichés about fame and fulfillment not always going hand in hand, her book recounts the group\'s ups and downs with clarity and emotional involvement."" ', '""Written by the terrific Dominique Morisseau who knows how to blend a story and a song...But it’s Trujillo whose vision brings it alive as the Temps turn, slide, move, and groove and snap their fingers in rhythmic perfection in a way that still resounds and gives pause to why The Temptations remain part of our musical soundtrack. It’s a hi-powered, dynamic and energetic cast that will make you love them while you, the audience, can’t help but mouth or sing the familiar tunes."" ', '""The leads, voices, acting, choreography by Sergio Trujillo, direction by Des McAnuff, songs and book are all here. This doesn’t mean that the show is flawless. This could have been one of the greatest jukebox musicals, if it wasn’t for the artistic design team: sets, costumes and lighting making the evening duller and less exciting that it actually is...Besides the song catalog you are left with six excellent performances and voices that give the show its gravitas and knocks you out."" ', '“The group’s connection with the civil rights movement is poignantly explored, which does great justice to the importance and significance of the Temptations...As a musical, ‘Ain’t Too Proud’ isn’t anything special per se, but as a jukebox it is rather good, certainly better than most...It’s hard to resist some of their classic hits...and when they are expertly sung...’Ain’t Too Proud’ is perfect for a fun night of well-performed nostalgia, with some history on the side.” ', '“Based on Otis Williams’ autobiography...Morisseau has fashioned a book that doesn’t always stick to the facts...The Motown music– mostly from Smokey Robinson and Norman Whitfield– is what propels the show. The orchestra, which is on stage behind the action, is sensational. And the actors are just knockouts...’Ain’t Too Proud’ shows off a phenomenon.” ', '""While not exactly profound or original, it makes for slick, straightforward, tuneful and altogether pleasant entertainment...An effort was made to bring up unsavory details including drug and alcohol addiction, physical abuse and violence, juvenile delinquency, family abandonment and racial prejudice. But by and large, this remains a by-the-numbers, self-glorifying, sanitized account of the band’s life and times...The cast is uniformly strong."" ', '""In Otis’ narration, the lives of the men behind the voices are generally reduced to one or two digestible traits...Inner lives are given only cursory glimpses, as much of the book by Dominique Morisseau gets caught up documenting the group’s shuffling roster of members...But then, the Temptations are beloved for their soaring vocals, smooth moves and slick suits. Director Des McAnuff sets the production whizzing and spinning with ease like a classic record on a turntable.""

The trick to sustaining love at first sight, their show suggests, is to never stop looking."" ', '""A deceptively simple affair: a stage largely unadorned save for musical instruments, a book by playwright Gancher that gives a voice both wry and poignant to the story of the Bengsons’ meeting and marriage, and of course, a collection of lush, plaintive, soaring songs...Shaun is a model of the classically self-effacing, hella-talented indie rock musician—his guitar holds the show together—and Abigail, out of her roiling anxiety, is able to release a vocal hurricane."" ', '""In one scene, we watch the couple foresee growing older, decade by decade: both a witty meditation on maturity and a sober meditation on mortality. Under Anne Kaufmann’s subtle and clever direction, Abigail and Shaun and the band do not stay still...Every musician plays powerfully, but it is Abigail’s wail of sadness and pain in her key song that stays with you, piercing the night.""

', '""The inherent sadness of the situation is an essential part of an eclectic score that is anything but sad in its execution. It\'s hard to put a label on this very listenable and exciting score...Perhaps a decision was made early on to keep \'Days\' contained in an uncluttered musical framework that is uncompromisingly direct in its presentation. Without gilding the lyrics (I wish I could have heard them more distinctly) a little more imagination in the staging wouldn\'t have hurt."" ', '""Abigail delivers some of the most unearthly vocals that I have heard in a long, long time...Some of their songs are quite fetching...But it isn\'t very long into \'Hundred Days\' before the feeling sets in that the Bengsons aren\'t really playing fair with us...Leaves one with the feeling that the Bengsons, for all their surface charm, are a self-involved and self-dramatizing pair...Even so, \'Hundred Days\' is informed by real talent and enjoys a sleek production."" ', '""The format of the work is unsatisfactory. The book they wrote with Sarah Gancher is basically a song cycle interrupted by dialog. At a crucial point in the evening there is a long stretch of dialog where I would have expected music to carry the emotional thrust, as if they mistrusted the expressive power of their music to get the job done. To my senior ears, the music was much too loud and percussive and the lyrics were occasionally hard to decipher."" ', ""“Despite its emotionalism and theme of death's imminence, the show barely touches one's heart…Wonderful as they are on a stand-alone basis, the songs too often seem more about themselves or their emotional workings than the drama they're supposed to illuminate. Too often, the lyrics get lost during the musical pyrotechnics…It's hard to become involved in their characters, about whom we learn only the barest minimum. They come off more as abstractions than people about whom we care very much.” "", '""To accept it as a musical, or judge it as a work of theater – I must then acknowledge the frustration of trying to follow a story that is often vague in its details and mumbly in its presentation. Shaun and Abigail are personable singer-songwriters and sometimes droll storytellers, but they are clearly not trained actors nor experienced dramatists…Passed more quickly for me once I treated the spoken words as patter between the songs."" ', '""Despite its rollicking indie rock- and folk-flavored score, it feels entirely like TMI...There\'s little dramatic tension derived from watching the couple making moony eyes at each other, and their profuse declarations of love become more than a little grating...All this is a shame, because their music proves consistently tuneful and engaging, even if the amplification often prevents the lyrics, so important to the storyline, from being fully understood."" ', '""It’s a rock cycle for which much has been done to make it theater-stage-worthy by director Anne Kauffman. Much has been done, but to little avail...The music is blandly insistent, the lyrics aren’t consistently intelligible and Abigail Bengson’s pipes reside somewhere between belt and strident...The musicians-back-up singers, are first-rate.""

The similarities don’t end there — but this adaptation goes its own way and then some, with an innovative approach to staging and a breathtaking melding of art forms.""

Just about everything in this happily dance-drunk show moves with a spring in its step.""

Occasionally the show stubs its toes on corny jokes and book scenes that could use a bit more finesse, such as Jerry’s clunky wartime reflections. That’s nitpicking — just a bit of minor turbulence during this lighter-than-air ride.""

When the music is this glorious, who\'s complaining?

But an awkward transition or two can\'t diminish the pleasures of a show that\'s one long sustained swoon."" ', '""There is nothing self-conscious about ""An American in Paris.""

The number can\'t match the cinematic detail of the original, of course. But overall, it\'s a dazzling achievement in its own right.""

Everything in this new musical moves — from the actors (two of whom just happen to be world class dancers), to the fabulously “choreographed” projection-enhanced sets and costumes...And even when the dialogue falls a bit flat, the story is in such perpetual motion that words seem almost beside the point. Dance is the only language really needed here."" ', '""Why does ""An American in Paris"" feel so fresh? First-time Broadway director Christopher Wheeldon has turned it into a modern ballet...it’s mesmerizing, unlike anything I’ve witnessed on Broadway before...While this is what makes An American in Paris special, it’s not the whole show.

Forget what you know about the movie, because Christopher Wheeldon, the director and choreographer, has truly reinvented a new, old-fashioned-style musical…The one drawback of the musical is the book by Craig Lucas, and the forced obligatory humor that has to be injected into a serious musical."" ', '""If ""An American in Paris"" fails as an integrated musical, it soars as choreography, and ought to be seen, admired, and appreciated as such. By marshaling dance as few others have on Broadway in recent memory, Wheeldon has provided us a jolting reminder of the incomparable, incalculable power of dance to speak of our deepest longings and agonies when words and even lyrics cannot."" ', '""Surreal collisions of song, dance and visual art capture the desires of young expats and Parisians to create something beautiful as they rediscover their city in the aftermath of World War II...It feels like two shows. One is a great ballet, the other an uneven musical...the book can be heavy-handed...These spoken scenes often give way to appealingly sung classics, but it\'s when dance is involved that the show truly takes off."" ', '""The musical, visually beautiful though structurally thin and frequently shaky, delivers this nostalgic charm against a gorgeous backdrop of a post-war Paris...The final product feels to be a patchwork musical, indulging us with visual spectacles and beloved melodies at the expense of cohesive musical storytelling...Those seeking a nostalgic evening of George and Ira Gershwin\'s music will find much to love, and the show is a must-see for anyone with a passion for ballet."" ', '""With its odd combination of dour outlook and joyful movement, and its very tasteful corralling of the giddy Gershwin songs from disparate sources that constitute its score, the show is a Broadway unicorn...The attempt to merge dance storytelling with musical-theater storytelling may not always be satisfying but especially at a time when more conventional musicals aspire to the condition of high-speed sledgehammers, it is a delight to relax into a show with a dreamier pace.""

The cast for one thing...Some of the songs are simply wonderful...Story and character and craft and skill and meaning add up to crap...Director O’Hara has to work a damn hard to make this \'tall tale\' make some kind of sense. He only partway succeeds...A show that can’t make up its mind whether it’s serious or comic...But it’s fun and it’s tuneful and silly, and if you don’t mind not being able to figure it all out, it’s worth seeing just for the splendid performances."" ', '“The show never sets on a consistent tone, nor does it successfully bring all the disparate strands of the story together. The result is episodic, sprawling, and wan…The whimsy of Childs’ story falls a bit flaccid in O’Hara’s static treatment of the material. The second act is especially loose, and could easily have been trimmed by 20 to 30 minutes…Child’s lyrics show considerable craft…There’s enough here in \'Bella\' to make me hope that Childs keeps writing."" ', '“For most of the first act, it\'s barely a tale at all, so crammed is it with numbers that go nowhere and characters who quickly vanish from the narrative…There is a very good point wandering around inside ‘Bella,’ but it is obscured by an excess of silliness and vulgarity…Under the fast-paced and often inventive direction of Robert O\'Hara, an appealing cast works hard to maintain an engaging mood, even during the more embarrassing episodes."" ', '""This show leaves us scratching our heads...I’m not sure I understand the directorial choice of having so many characters be so campy and over-the-top, but it certainly didn’t help keep me engaged in this meandering concoction or care about the outcome...Kelley, as Bella, is the shining star in this circus of a show...It’s just a shame she is centered in the swirl of a musical that is having an identity crisis, saddled with some of the silliest scenarios I’ve seen."" ', '""The collection of ambitions and forms and storytelling devices can’t sustain a consistent position on this particular juxtaposition between depicting a powerful black female in the 1870s who is battling to reclaim her ancestry versus the action-hero 21st century satirical version of the same female who effortlessly fights off the bad guys by booty-smacking them...The prevailing tone is one of antic silliness, one that straddles the line between the absurd and the asinine.""

Despite their common roots, \'Carmelina\' is tighter than \'Mamma Mia!,\' boasting higher stakes and a more focused character plot.

It delivers.""

', '""In Deaf West\'s exhilarating reboot of the moody and stirring 2007 Tony winner, the repressed and rudderless kids are lifting more than their voices. They’re also raising their hands to express themselves — and casting a whole new spell. The show combines hearing and non-hearing actors who use American Sign Language. Some roles are played by two actors — one who sings, one who signs. Many in the cast do both at once. The result: Lines and lyrics look as poetic and provocative as they sound.""

Fluently staged by Doyle and performed so winningly, this \'Carmen Jones,\' like its heroine, is irresistible.""

', '""A remarkably moving and highly spirited condensation of one section of Leo Tolstoy’s seminal novel \'War and Peace\'...Which leads us to the sheer amount of blazing talent we are blessed to share our time with...Malloy has an incredible facility to traverse genre...Malloy’s greatest musical triumphs may be his witty, infectious numbers...You’ll also get a kick, at times, from Sam Pinkleton’s choreography, which smartly complements Chavkin’s staging."" ', '""Great, extravagantly entertaining fun, with a soaring score that runs the musical gamut from raucous rock to classical...It also stirs the soul, with a beautifully sung finale, performed to a hushed audience by pop star Josh Groban…It might not cure your heartache, but it\'s a reminder of the solace that art can provide…Onstage, there\'s unparalleled intimacy, with the actors excitingly close. The negative is that with actors continually brushing by, you can get distracted from the story."" ', '""A stunningly original piece of work that elevates the pop opera genre to new heights on Broadway…For the most part, the sung-through show is a riot of movement and music performed by perhaps the most exuberant company to be found on the Main Stem…Among the principals, Denée Benton makes a glorious Broadway debut as a graceful and animated Natasha."" ', '""My third time with ‘The Great Comet’ was the best of all, especially because the environmental staging worked so well with the theater transformed into a mass of runways…With the constant swirling motion, the sung-through musical is clever, funny, sexy, and dizzyingly colorful, and blessed with a tip-top cast (including a very persuasive Josh Groban) that keeps your head Russian."" ', '""A whirling, swirling onstage carnival in which the actors cavort with audience members and the entire theater is transformed into a performance space...That the music by Dave Malloy is so wide-ranging and rich makes the accomplishment all the more awe-inspiring...Whatever its storytelling shortcomings, \'Natasha, Pierre\' more than compensates with whimsy and ravishing beauty...Like the greatest works of art, this one leaves you feeling privileged to have experienced it."" ', '""A musical unlike anything else on Broadway...As incredible as the set is, though, it\'s not the star. That billing belongs, not to the velvet-voiced pop star Josh Groban who plays Pierre, but to Broadway newcomer Denée Benton. Benton sparkles as Natasha...Whimsy and wit permeates \'The Great Comet.\' It\'s a dazzling production. Like the comet it\'s named for, the show brings wonder in its wake."" ', '""Malloy and Chavkin, unceasingly inventive, explore this sliver of Tolstoy\'s vast tale fully, with a glorious, free-ranging mixture of panache, tenderness, and common-sense directness…The lyrics, if occasionally prosy, bear the narrative weight…Chavkin and her team second this with soulful, strongly rooted performances…Everyone\'s excellent, but Groban\'s Pierre is a creation sure to linger; he gives this giant, swirling spectacle a core reason far beyond anything in most recent musicals."" ', '""Few theatergoers have seen something as lavish and as complicated as this...\'The Great Comet\' is immersive theater at its finest...Despite the warnings of a dizzying array of names and people, since the characters sing points of narration and make clear whom they are referring to, the story is easy to follow...The pageantry is simply spectacular and it all makes sense in the end."" ', '""Deeply drawn characters and insightful storytelling…This is a raucous, fascinating musical based on a few chapters of \'War and Peace\' and there is no chance of you falling asleep…I was not a Josh Groban fan going in, but he is perfectly cast as the introspective, corpulent Pierre and his singing and acting shine through on his journey of awakening…However, I would not recommend this show to anyone who only favors old-fashioned musicals. This is art. Sublime, delicious art.” ', '""Director Rachel Chavkin\'s brilliantly joyous and sneakily subversive mounting of ‘The Great Comet,’ an infectiously lively musical…Josh Groban supplies the attention-grabbing star name and does a fine job anchoring the festivities with gravitas…Denée Benton\'s Natasha revels in the spotlight much of the time and she reflects it luminously with a lovely voice and a glowing presence...Let this dazzling show fill your spirits all night long."" ', '""Malloy\'s sung-through lyrics are clear as any play dialogue and propel the narrative most effectively. And Chavkin has guided the performers to make their situations and feelings easily comprehensible...Electro-pop-influenced and sung-through like an opera, but it also, and beautifully, blends in Russian folk and classical music...They\'ve managed to give audiences a view of Tolstoy\'s rather overwrought romantic subplot through a contemporary and often humorous and unique lens."" ', '""All of the movement and interaction with audience members add to the excitement. But when all is said and done, the acting and singing carry the day and stir emotions. The score is dynamic and intriguingly varied, and there are outstanding performing turns...If you want to see a particularly unusual show, head for the Imperial. The theater itself is something to see and experience in its new version revamped for this run."" ', '""It’s a massive, luscious, romantic escape into decadent 19th-century Moscow by way of Broadway...A multifaceted talent named Dave Malloy wrote and composed this seriously beautiful lark of an oddball musical...Directed by the spectacle-wizard Rachel Chavkin...Inextricable from the music and story are the overwhelming sets and costumes—sensory overload with little on its mind except offbeat entertainment.""

And while the show moves towards a fairly predictable ending, it offers many surprises along the way. It\'s a musical that is unexpectedly charming and entertaining, despite its macabre premise.""

The use of many clichés is probably meant as comic but only go unnoticed as the show moves so fast. The expert cast makes the most of their opportunities but the basic question as to the intended audience for this bizarre story is never resolved. And the show is surprisingly upbeat considering the subject matter.” ', '""This quirky show pushes hard for its desired audience response, be it laughter or tears. Unfortunately, it\'s not nearly as funny as the writers seem to think and a last-minute U-turn toward schmaltz comes across as unearned…Everyone in the cast works up a sweat selling the material they have to work with...Under the steady and efficient direction of Rachel Rockwell, the whole thing feels like a Fringe Festival musical with really high production values."" ', '""A lengthy cooking time has only resulted in a derivative, if energetically plated stew...\'Cyclone\' earns points for its hectic mix of misanthropic satire and small-town melancholy, and the eclectic score keeps things lively—Brooke Maxwell and Jacob Richmond\'s tunes run the gamut from Ukrainian rap to French chanson and indie pop. But at 100 minutes, this gaudily hand-painted car trundles along after the thrill has faded."" ', '""\'Ride the Cyclone\' lives up to its namesake amusement park ride: it has moments of fear and exhilaration, and is ultimately rather diverting. Still, like most such rides, it’s fun while it lasts, yet will be forgotten hours, if not, minutes later…The show’s shortcomings lie firmly in the hands of its co-authors…First, their characters rarely feel more than two-dimensional…More problematic is that the pair’s pastiche-driven score never makes as much of an impression as it should."" ', '""Curiously lacking in any kind of emotion or tension. Director and choreographer Rachel Rockwell\'s production is a lively one, featuring a boisterously talented cast...But while the book contains a decent number of guffaws and the score exudes a pleasant assortment of contemporary sounds, the hints that something of significant profundity is contained within the text are left unfulfilled.""

Sometimes I could. More of the time, however, I just couldn\'t...The frequently poetic lyrics are just as often accompanied by banal, derivative tunes.""

Instead, you\'ll relish the power and grace of this show, and emerge uplifted.""

Add to that the winning performances by the cast, especially Ben Platt, this musical will get under your skin and speak to you in so many ways...Here is an original musical that didn’t skip any steps, wraps its audience in its arms and allows the music, the story and the characters to do their jobs."" ', '""Platt is giving one of the greatest leading male performances I’ve ever seen in a musical, and the thrillingly modern and moving \'Dear Evan Hansen\' is worthy of it...The musical benefits mightily from Greif’s dynamic direction, Korins’s vivid set design, Nigrini\'s cascading projections and an excellent cast...Benj Pasek and Justin Paul’s score brims with tuneful and thoughtful songs...And Levenson’s book is unfailingly smart...\'Dear Evan Hansen\' must be seen to be believed."" ', '""It is a musical of our time and for generations to come...Michael Grief has taken this complicated tale and directed it with the lightest of touches. He knows it’s a heady topic and he treats all the action and movements with the utmost respect. The book by Steven Levenson is brilliant; he combines teenage angst and pains with today’s social media and all its trappings. The score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul is a marvel."" ', '""An original, emotional, affecting musical, free of stunt casting, is on Broadway...Levenson\'s book is both funny and touching; Pasek and Paul\'s score features accessible pop and smart, raw lyrics that reveal depth of character. It\'s going to be a great day because Rachel Bay Jones knocks you out with her portrayal of a frazzled, trying mother, and because Ben Platt gives a stunning, star-making performance as the exposed nerve that is our title character...Platt is the real thing."" ', '""Full of heart, led by an extraordinary central performance from Ben Platt, and featuring a score of rapturous and rhapsodic joy, this is a wonderful, wonderful piece of theatre…It is splendid and moving, truthful and hopeful, tragic and humorous...There is not a single moment when energy or skill flags…\'Dear Evan Hansen\' is a masterpiece, a truly inspirational musical and a theatrical marvel...Completely different from, but ultimately better than, \'Hamilton.\'"" ', '""So fine in its craft and rich in its gathering of themes that it rewards being seen again—and again...Platt imbues the character with so much pathos and lively detail that he succeeds as the story’s engine despite being almost pathologically passive...That Levenson has been able to find spots for humor at all in this grippingly sad story, and that Pasek and Paul have been able to turn those opportunities into songs of comic relief is a sign of the size of the ideas in play."" ', '""The marvelous young actor Ben Platt is giving a performance that’s not likely to be bettered on Broadway this season. What’s more, this gorgeous heartbreaker of a musical has grown in emotional potency during its journey to the big leagues...The musical finds endless nuances in the relationships among its characters...Under the superb direction of the veteran Michael Greif, the show has been subtly refined, its brasher comedy softened, and the performances have grown in delicacy.""  ', '""Platt nails each shifting mood and tone as a socially inept outcast. Original and up-to-the-minute, the musical has a lot to say—about parents and children, social media, and more...Stirring ballads and rousing group songs in the vibrant, varied score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul ooze emotions. Director Michael Greif excels at guiding actors through complex stories—and his work has never been better...The show\'s so satisfying it deserves a thank-you note."" ', '""A smart, deeply felt and altogether extraordinary new musical...Pasek and Paul have crafted a haunting soft rock score that is neatly integrated into Levenson’s captivating book. Greif presents a tight and compelling production built around finely-textured ensemble acting and a seamless visual design of shifting panels and floating video imagery. Platt is giving one of the most vulnerable and shaded performances you’ve ever seen."" ', '""What\'s perhaps most distinctive about Pasek and Paul\'s melodic emo-pop score is how beautifully it captures the peaks and valleys of adolescence, in the thoughtful lyrics and in the music itself...Playwright Steven Levenson matches the musical components beat for beat in his terrific book, which sets up with persuasive conviction what could easily have been a contrived premise...Across the board, the ensemble is superb, each of them registering rich moments of emotional complexity."" ', '""Ben Platt is stripped down to his emotional skivvies for us voyeurs to judge, gawk at, and pity. His breathtaking performance in the show\'s title role is just one of the reasons Pasek, Paul, and Levenson\'s new musical moves audiences to their feet before the lights even come down...This musical offers a truly 21st-century story...The composers strike a balance between substance and popular appeal with memorable melodies and character-driven lyrics."" ', '""Trensch claims the role in a unique way - adding nervous tics and vocal inflections that allow us to see a different if nonetheless equally compelling star turn...Happily, the rest of the cast stayed on and the performances have deepened believe it or not...But let’s not forget the humor, which has only become more pointed and rich...\'Dear Evan Hansen\' will touch you in ways you probably never expected."" ', '""This isn’t your usual Broadway musical–it’s better! It’s funny, sad, tragic and filled with great heart. This is a powerful story of a young, high-school misfit played by the remarkable Ben Platt, whose physical and emotionally nuanced performance is so compelling and sensitive that one is in awe...Michael Greif helms the cast with a magical directorial hand...Many Tony nominations and expected awards for this one!!"" ', '""While maintaining that improbable balance between pathos and audacious irreverence for over two hours, director Michael Greif expertly sets forth an intricately crafted plot...Benj Pasek and Justin Paul also make the familiar sound fresh by blending rock, country and folk rhythms...More remarkable still is the philosophical depth of Levenson’s book, which provocatively suggests a comforting illusion might be preferable to grim reality in the internet age."" ', '""A highly imaginative and moving musical…If anything, \'Dear Evan Hansen,\' with the extraordinary Ben Platt in the title role, has grown in stature and lost none of the intimacy that made it so effective in the original…The material is well plotted, and it builds to a smashing climax which raises the stakes and gives Mr. Platt a chance to soar with eloquence…\'Dear Evan Hansen\' is a major contribution to musical theatre and the Broadway season."" ', '""Rarely does a show come along that sits in the pit of my stomach, evoking those intense waves of emotion that come at life-altering moments...Levenson’s book offers just enough twists to keep the audience engaged without diverting into too many subplots. His success is in the development of fully realized, nuanced characters...Ultimately it’s the ensemble of eight actors that delivers the impact of \'Dear Evan Hansen.\' as well as a message of hope that we could all use right now."" ', '""It’s not simply that the songs are tuneful. It’s that they have a way of instantly piercing your heart and burrowing into your consciousness, while also illuminating character and propelling the plot (no small achievement!)...Credit librettist Steven Levenson for creating such a believable young character, from the anxiety meds to the self-deprecating dialogue. It also doesn’t hurt that Platt possesses, on top of a powerhouse voice, a seemingly limitless reserve of charm."" ', '""The musical boasts a darkly textured and deeply nuanced book and provocative songs that are drenched in feeling and fearless commitment. It never sentimentalizes its subject, but feels constantly truthful...This show registers its emotions with a frank, fearless ambivalence. The tone of uncertainty and palpable unease is stunningly projected by Platt...There are equally impressive performances from the other seven actors in the tight ensemble of Greif\'s deeply felt production."" ', '""I was practically heaving with sobs by the end…Ben Platt is giving an extraordinary, star-making performance as Evan Hansen…His singing is first-rate, of course, but his complete immersion into this awkward, idiosyncratic kid is totally complete…The entire score is fantastic and I can\'t wait until I can get the cast album…The entire cast is incredibly wonderful…It made me think about so many things, alongside having the enjoyment of seeing a terrific piece of theater."" ', '""It’s a winner in every sense of the word. There is laughter and plenty of tears, soaring melodies, a brilliant scenic design and a message that teens and parents both will understand…Beautifully directed…With this performance, Platt will become a Broadway star. He may not have the most powerful voice, but it seems to be perfect for the role…The surrounding cast is excellent."" ', '""The whole sorry story is treated by the authors with a remarkable double vision, keeping us engaged with Evan as he careens ever closer to disaster...The songs similarly combine real feeling with sharp-eyed observation as they briskly move the story along...Greif\'s staging is both well-paced and nuanced, never losing sight of the heartbreak at the story\'s center; he has also assembled a cast of performers who wear their characters like old clothes."" ', '""\'Dear Evan Hansen\' has changed now that it’s on Broadway, in ways that make it an even more affecting musical. Ben Platt’s performance, impressive from the get-go, is even better...The transfer feels seamless. The unchanged score holds up, comprised of the same tuneful and moving songs...All give superb performances. Platt has toned down his nervousness – he fidgets less – which makes his performance all the more credible, all the more heartbreaking."" ', '""\'Dear Evan Hansen\' has not lost any of its power and tension. It soars with an intense beauty that still captures our hearts and plays havoc with it all at the same time...Not much has changed with \'Dear Evan Hansen\' beyond a tightening of its components. Visually it’s as perfect and awe-inspiring as it was Off-Broadway. Maybe even more so...I’m not sure if I will ever feel completely content with the final moments, but all in all, \'Dear Evan Hansen\' delivers us a deeply felt rich story."" ', '""Not since \'Next to Normal\' has a score tapped so deeply into the troubled psyche of its needy protagonist...The lyrics go beyond the spoken thought and reach for the unspoken feelings hiding behind the words. Better yet, there’s not a hint of sentimentality...Under the thoughtful direction of Greif, Platt goes beyond physical specificity to get under Evan’s skin and into his unsettled mind.  And the introspective, gentle score becomes the language of his troubled thoughts and yearnings."" ', '""Heart-stirring and often shattering. But it’s not just the show’s universal and topical subject matter, smarty explored by Steven Levenson’s mostly well-written book or Benj Pasek and Justin Paul’s lovely, deeply felt score, that lends the work such pathos. What makes \'Evan Hansen\' so special, and oddly lovable, is the brave and extraordinarily raw performance by Ben Platt...In the end, \'Dear Evan Hansen\' is both a must-see musical and a tribute to the singular talents of its rising star.""

Springsteen on Broadway,"['“There came a moment near the end of Springsteen’s overwhelming and uncategorizable Broadway show, when it seemed possible to see straight through his many masks to some core truth of his being….‘Springsteen on Broadway’ is a solo act by a solo artist with an artist’s steel…A painful if thrilling summing-up at 68: a major statement about a life’s work, but also a major revision of it…As portraits of artists go, there may never have been anything as real — and beautiful — on Broadway.”  ', '“His extraordinary new stage production...Part storytelling, part singing — almost entirely without cracking a smile...Stripped down, accompanied with just piano or guitar...His voice hasn’t diminished over the years the way some prettier ones do. It’s built for the gravitas that comes with experience...Intimate, unforgettable show... It’s like therapy, or a lovers’ heart-to-heart: you leave feeling you’ve journeyed with a superstar to the depths of his troubled soul."" ', '“Here he presents himself not as the stadium-filling rock god, but instead he engages in a more intimate and difficult process, collapsing the distance between artist and audience, between his art and the lived experience of those who take comfort and solace in it…Springsteen clarifies the meanings and the substance of his songs with a becoming simplicity and humility occasionally trimmed with humor...A remarkable performance of some of his greatest music."" ', '""The hits are here, including ‘Born to Run’ and ‘Dancing in the Dark,’ but stripped down and edged with wistfulness; ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ is pared into a skeletal, nearly acapella blues. It’s an intimate show and a generous one, not just to past friends and collaborators but also to the audience, inviting us on a cross-country journey that is now, as he approaches 70, less about the gunning of his engines than the steadiness of his drive. He pulls it all off; he’s understood. It’s magic."" ', '""A two-hour, 15-song set that left everyone breathless...Meticulously scripted, yet still retains the air of being off-the-cuff, \'Springsteen on Broadway\' offers a walk through the artist\'s life...The most exciting aspect is how Bruce still manages to surprise us after all these decades...This emotional honesty, on display throughout the evening, could only register in a venue like the Walter Kerr...An unforgettable experience."" ', '“A beautifully crafted reflection on his life, his career, and his country…There is, however, a robust narrative shape, a deceptively rambling but cohesive vision of personal and professional experience…The anecdotes and song choices work together hand in glove, shifting with ease from humor to sadness…The show is a model of finely chiseled simplicity, by turns contemplative, moving and joyous…Anyone lucky enough to catch \'Springsteen on Broadway\' will be witnessing rock history."" ', '""There is no grand autobiographical sweep, just an episodic succession of granular memories...With Springsteen’s voice still remarkably un-blurred at 68, the intimate setting ensures that each lyric has complete poetic clarity...The only drawback here is that Springsteen relies on an autocue. He thus sacrifices a bit of spontaneity for fidelity to his own finely crafted text...You’ll never get another chance to get this close, in every sense, to The Boss."" ', ""“It’s elegant, it’s austere, it’s moving. And oh my God, it’s Bruce…A taut and beautifully turned-out evening as sincerely wrought as a poetry reading…It’s a quest for a New York audience to listen for the craft in an American voice ringing with simple truths…He is blazing a trail for other recording artists of his mass appeal and rarefied caliber to come to midtown and create something just as artfully interesting…The long prose passages of 'Springsteen on Broadway' are deeply emotional.” "", '“A performance that few lucky enough to attend will ever forget…Springsteen could easily have turned his autobiography over to Broadway hacks, who would have jumped at the chance at adapting his life story into a jukebox musical. But thankfully he created something more artfully haunting…His prose, even when overripe, conveys the richness of his heart. But his presence onstage communicates his soul...Broadway, it turns out, is an ideal highway for his mature artistry.” ', '“An authentic, thoughtfully-constructed vehicle, performed by an artist and showman who knows what it means to give his audiences their money’s worth...Springsteen is the real deal; he’s an electric, enthralling presence. There is never a doubt that you are in the presence of greatness, a living legend. But what’s extraordinary about his performance at the Kerr is the naturalness and casual gravity he conveys; it’s completely seductive. Exultant.” ', '""It’s an extraordinary gift — to bring people together, to make us recognize that what binds us matters more than what divides us. And it has been displayed in a new and exciting fashion...An evening of stories and songs in which the icon turns the spotlight squarely on his own story...It’s spare and stripped-down, a quiet evening of reflection that is both melancholy and funny, stricken with pain and filled with defiance."" ', '""This is nothing like a typical latter-day Springsteen concert...The intensity is, instead, emotional, as Springsteen digs hard into the bedrock of his life story...One of the most compelling and profound shows by a rock musician in recent memory...There\'s an incredible power to sitting so close from him while he strums a guitar...and tells his life story in rich detail...Each segment is designed for maximum emotional impact...A fresh, powerful artistic achievement in its own right."" ', '""Two hours of music and storytelling interlaced with a kind of warm intimacy...At such close range, Springsteen’s precision as performer is quite astounding, each moment deliberate yet effortless...He can conjure a crowd, too, pitching his tone somewhere between beat poet and baptist preacher...He pays respect to the transformative, ludicrous joy of what he does – and to its importance, too...Deep and joyful."" ', '""Lets one of popular music’s most beloved icons flex all kinds of creative muscle in a rare, intimate setting that showcases the true breadth of talents...Knowing the stories doesn’t ruin the magic; instead, there’s an added richness and warmth that comes with experiencing them live in a multi-disciplinary, 360-degree performance...Springsteen’s an ace dry comedian, but he’s even better when he’s breaking your heart...A fuller picture of Springsteen, the human."" ', '""Springsteen like he’s never been seen and heard before...\'Springsteen on Broadway\' puts its audience through an emotional wringer....Very much a show, with the theatrical space used to create naturalistic effect...Is it a concert, or is it a play? Neither, but something fresher, born from a combination of the two...By recontextualizing them as part of a highly personal, dramatically told story, it makes the old songs sound new again."" ', '""There is a very precise rhythm that carries from piece to piece, creating an emotional intensity that is not unfamiliar and at times profoundly moving...It is not afraid to tell the hard truths; it is genuine; it is self-deprecating; and it is full of love and appreciation...The production was intense and powerful and a more than credible summation of the life and career of one of our greatest American performers. It was an unflinching attempt at an honest recounting of his story."" ', '“‘Springsteen on Broadway’ manages to be revelatory not only to casual fans but also to diehards...It does so by using the songs to back up and illustrate the stories he’s telling...The songs are not chosen because they’re hits, but because they’re key to the story he’s telling...You cannot watch the show without feeling that Springsteen is sharing something profound, and is doing so in a bold and fresh form that everyone in the theater is privileged to experience.” ', '""The master storyteller delivers a meticulous, astonishing performance featuring monologues and poetry...and fresh, innovative interpretations of some of his best loved songs...The space is so small – and Springsteen’s personality so absorbing – that at times it feels like a private, \'living room\' concert...Springsteen’s voice, which remains powerful, is toned down from his usual performances...Rather, the songs are often smartly reimagined and guitar solos more sedate."" ', '“‘Springsteen on Broadway’ is intimate and persuasive, satisfying and soul-stirring…A tightly scripted chronological narrative tracing his life…Between acoustic arrangements and slow tempos, lyrics really resonate. Springsteen is in complete command when he’s singing…Being locked to a script at times stunts his naturalness and ease. But the intimacy of the setting — and his magnetism — make up for occasional lapses in spontaneity.” ', '""You might think Bruce Springsteen doesn’t belong on Broadway, but you would be wrong…‘Springsteen on Broadway’ is a perfect concert…An electrifying (well, an acoustifying) session of mostly big big songs rendered without embellishment…‘Springsteen on Broadway’ is written as much as sung and, rock’n’roll or no, it’s a serious gig. Bruce flattered everyone there with his attention, and the attention to detail."" ', '""He is as authentic as they come - a true poet musician - and perhaps the best that we\'ve got...Much like his own persona, the staging is quite basic, gritty, and raw...At 68, Bruce Springsteen is clearly thinking about mortality, and his show is something of a soulful elegy. That might disappoint some fans. But he is The Boss after all, and listening to his reveries about home and family, he comes to own that stage; and for two glorious, intermission-less hours, he owns us, too."" ', '""Neither a musical nor a concert in the tradition of his previous solo tours...A meticulously crafted, deeply personal journey with set words and music...An affirmation of the exuberant showmanship and vivid storytelling that Springsteen\'s rock and roll shares with musical theatre...As the show progressed the emphasis shifted to more mature concerns and rewards. It\'s here that Springsteen\'s ability to open his heart and transcend sentimentality came to the fore.” ', '“The New Jersey native has proved...that he is right at home on the Great White Way...More reminiscent of his solo tours...Yet it is not a concert...’Springsteen on Broadway’ is a moving, powerful exploration of a man and his innate, unquenchable desire to become a successful musician...Springsteen has always been an engaging storyteller, and he takes it to the next level on Broadway, unafraid to reveal his faults along with his triumphs.” ', '""He’s like us: he struggles with his childhood, has father issues, and admits to stretching the truth at times. In this way, he is disarming as hell. That makes his Broadway show transcendent. And transplendent. And kind of magnificent. He’s not like us at all: he is a master showman, a gifted musician...A highlight of this show is \'The Rising,\' written about 9-11. His face is different when he sings it. That’s when he transcends a night with a rocker on Broadway."" ', '""\'Springsteen on Broadway\' is the anti-Broadway Broadway show. No sets, no effects, no dancing girls...In one respect it follows the Broadway formula exactly. \'Story and songs, integrated by a strong dramatic line\'....The sound was notably excellent: Springsteen got incredible dynamic range out of a single instrument...This is another kind of excitement: the excitement of a familiar song becoming part of a larger narrative, the story of Bruce, his life, his soul, his vision of America.""

Groundhog Day The Musical,"['“Exhilarating...‘Groundhog Day’ combines an innovative premise with a fresh, eclectic score influenced by many genres…Andy Karl rockets into the stratosphere in ‘Groundhog Day’…He’s equally credible and fun as a snide lout, a drunken lech, or a budding humanitarian, plus his vocals and physical movement skills are top-notch. The surrounding production, inventively staged by Matthew Warchus, is a feast of the imagination.” ', '""A fabulous musical adaptation...Karl is a phenomenon as Connors...He is bursting with an infectious charisma and bewitching energy that envelops the audience from the very start and never lets go...He’s helped tremendously by an outstanding book that really understands the heart and soul of the film...The songs flow seamlessly into the story, with some brilliant surprises...Director Matthew Warchus never allows the show to get boring, despite so much repetition."" ', '""Tim Minchin’s musical is as hilarious as it is bracing. Matthew Warchus\' production has only grown in vividness and confidence since its premiere at the Old Vic last summer...Warchus and his expert collaborators have brought a finely tuned balance of Broadway-scale polish and an English-infused ironic pathos to the show that makes its constant repetitions worth revisiting."" ', '""A brilliant creative team and an outstanding leading man make this musical version of the beloved ‘90s movie an experience you’ll be happy to repeat...Warchus’ staging is a marvel...It’s safe to say there’s no current Broadway cast having more fun than this one...The show works. It gives restless audience members plenty of razzmatazz, while drawing in the more pensive ones with its surprisingly complex critique of American culture and our search for meaning in the modern world."" ', '""Wonderfully inventive...A giddy highlight of the current Broadway season...It takes Karl all of five minutes to win you over completely (resist as you might)...At times, \'Groundhog Day\' feels more like a plate-spinning magic trick than a Broadway musical...Spectacle is fine, but none of it much matters if the basics of the show don’t work. Thankfully, they do...Manages to hold onto everything that made Ramis’ movie such a classic and adds songs bound to become nearly as memorable."" ', '“The surprise here isn’t that  ‘Groundhog Day’ is good, or even how good it is. It’s how much Rubin, director Warchus, and composer and lyricist Minchin were able to mine from an existing story, making it richer and stronger in the process…Packs substance into each scene...That is some of the genius of Rubin’s reworking, which manages effortlessly to ask probing, personalizing questions of the narrative that were otherwise absent in the film.” ', '""A dizzyingly witty new musical...Mr. Karl is so outrageously inventive in ringing changes on the same old, same old, that you can’t wait for another (almost identical) day to dawn...Mr. Karl turns these different feelings into a replete gallery of self-portraits, drawn with both comic panache and genuine feeling...He uses every tool in the musical arsenal, too, often to devastating effect...NY audiences have the rare chance to witness the full emergence of a newborn, bona fide musical star."" ', '""Under director Matthew Warchus’s expert tutelage, Rubin and songwriter Tim Minchin shoot this clever story to the stage as if it belongs there every bit as much as it belonged on the screen...Minchin is delightfully iconoclastic once again...Karl is alternately nuanced and broad throughout the show as he carries the weight of this tuner lightly...It’s like the Groundhog Day on which it takes place: worth experiencing over and over (and over and over) again."" ', '""It\'s Karl\'s heroic performance that truly carries the piece. Overall, \'Groundhog Day\' is one of the more imaginative musicals of the season. When the material is combined with Warchus\' cinematic staging, it is also one of the most consistently thrilling...It\'s exactly what you want a Broadway musical to be: a high-concept spectacle but one that has a compelling story, hummable music, and smart-as-hell lyrics. Reliving \'Groundhog Day\' over and over would prove to be a real pleasure."" ', '""The fiendishly crafty creative team has devised a musical that cracks open the source material to amplify its themes...It requires resourcefulness to take an iconic character and reshape it from the ground up. But that\'s exactly what Karl does...The humanizing of a heel is a story as old as time, but the miracle of what Rubin, Minchin and Warchus have pulled off here is to tell it without resorting to treacle."" ', '""I saw Andy Karl in \'Groundhog Day\' on Thursday, and he was terrific. So, in fact, was the show, an ingenious, witty, dark yet joyously offbeat musical...Minchin’s music beguiles with odd phrase lengths and wildly unpredictable, amusing lyrics, while director Matthew Warchus and his first-rate cast take us through the day and its many conflations with a light touch that belies the head-spinning concept and scenic intricacy."" ', '""The film was a terrific zebra; the Broadway musical is a kind of unicorn...Minchin’s score makes a joyful noise, to be sure, but it is not unalloyed hoopla...This is an original score that will endure. The sometimes dense lyrics, by turns funny and poignant, leave you stretching to sort it all out at times. It’s more than worth the effort...Erasing the estimable Bill Murray in the audience’s memory is no small task—unless you are Andy Karl...On the performance side, the craft is stunning."" ', '""A winning combination that keeps giving, and giving, and giving, and giving...Just like the clever spinning set by Rob Howell, Matthew Warchus keeps the story line spinning cleverly with so many brilliant touches. Suffice it to say it keeps up with the movie. The fireworks that burst from the stage are nothing more than the vibrant talents of Andy Karl. He is a one-man irresistible dynamo."" ', '""This smart and fast-paced show does the amazing feat of taking a beloved story and making it better...Karl brings an undercurrent of joy and energy to the enterprise...This fun, funny and colorful show is also complex. Composer and lyricist Tim Minchin brings a modern insight and smart, edgy sensibility to the story. The cleverness of the lyrics is a constant surprise...If there is justice and good taste in the world, \'Groundhog Day\' will play forever."" ', '""A rollicking, bombastic adaptation...The playfulness and frivolity of the story are cranked up to 11 that doesn’t shy away from an equal measure of darkness and brutality...Not once does this show feel stale or repetitive even though it literally repeats the same day over and over and over again...You likely will not see another show this year that pulls off this much practical trickery this well...But for all the goodness the show accomplishes, it isn’t without some cringeworthy tendencies."" ', '""Andy Karl is such a charming, likable performer that he is reason enough to see this Broadway musical...The problem of including loads of repetition without inducing boredom is solved with some success, particularly in the second act. The music and lyrics by Tim Minchin are workmanlike. My main complaint about the show is that it is overproduced...I was also annoyed by the gratuitous profanity; dropping an F-bomb serves no purpose other than titillation."" ', '""Inventive, acerbic, and thoroughly irreverent...The story of \'Groundhog Day\' plays so well on stage because it reflects the dilemma of its performers. Whereas movie actors do a few takes and are done with it, the cast of any successful musical is fated to keep repeating itself for hundreds, if not thousands, of performances...You can’t help but think about all that carefully honed repetition when watching the enormously gifted and seemingly tireless Andy Karl.""  ', '""While \'Groundhog Day\' may not actually be the best musical, it is, as I said, very good...The story works. So does the cast...Yes, the show frequently seems on the verge of spinning out of control. But there is neat whimsy — I doubt you’ll soon forget the best car chase I’ve ever seen on stage — and genuine feeling, in part because Karl is a deeply appealing guy... In all, there’s a tremendous amount of pleasure to be had here. "" ', '""Overstuffed and near-chaotic production...This is still a new Broadway musical that works—even one that has a few moments of greatness, replayed and redux...Minchin is about the wittiest lyricist on any rialto, and his songs in this show are a series of deliciously funny, quirky and waggish little ditties that make you laugh out loud...It takes a few minutes to get used to what Karl is doing—but this really is, in the final analysis, a highly effective and intensely skillful lead performance."" ', '""Under Warchus\' inventive direction, the show moves at a seamless clip, yet the pacing on that busy set with its five turntables can seem frantic and redundant in spots, bordering on tedium...The performances are all fine...But this one belongs almost entirely to Andy Karl. He enters the ranks of Broadway\'s best leading men with warmth, charm and charisma to spare...As long as Karl remains front and center, the forecast for this \'Groundhog Day\' looks pretty bright!"" ', '""\'Groundhog Day\' shares with \'Matilda\' both an intriguing darkness and enough on-stage razzle-dazzle to seize your attention and hold it across two generally gut-busting acts...Director Warchus stages most scenes with vibrancy, particularly a car chase sequence...It’s marvelously good fun. As is, for the most part, all of \'Groundhog Day.\' The musical is mostly consistent with the devilish humor in its cinematic predecessor, and Karl is a magnetic leading man.” ', '""Karl handles the intricacies of Minchin’s lyric-heavy, not-so-melodic score with impressive ease; moves with grace or comedic flair; and delivers comic lines with panache...Director Warchus and choreographer Darling have melded their company into an energized ensemble, ripping with high spirits through the ever-increasingly frantic and darker replays of the story...Unfortunately, the book is somewhat undermined by the cartoonish costuming and playing of minor roles."" ', '""A wonderful experience...Matthew Warchus the director brings the show together to the delight of the audience...Andy Karl provides us with a Tony-worthy performance. He is absolutely brilliant and does it all which brings humanity to a difficult role...Mr. Karl’s stage presence and charisma carry the show...A fun evening but definitely keeping the show at an hour and a half would certainly be an enhancement."" ', '""Its treatment of the source material is duly deferential and just different enough...True to Minchin’s stand-up background, his lyrics are clever and often Sondheimian in their rhyme scheme. Only one tune feels gratuitous and out-of-place...The book by original screenwriter Danny Rubin wisely doesn’t interfere much with the baroque construction of the film, but is punched up and updated unobtrusively...\'Groundhog Day’s\' a bright spot."" ', '""This would seem like an impossible project to musicalize, but they’ve managed it with humor and charm. The numbers are cleverly done, there’s lots of well-staged physical action and stagecraft...Act One is better than Act Two—the long-simmering romance becomes a bit strained—and there are a couple of songs by minor characters that don’t gel, but the show is novel and Karl is not only nervy, he’s a delightful leading man.""

The lightness of the music and the subject matter is combined with operatic arias, which give the genre of operetta its distinct style.” ', '""This re-revival is even more splendid and joyful than the one I saw first...One great joy of this production is the exuberant 14-piece orchestra under the jubilant baton of Zalmen Mlotek, filling the theater with endless melodies that has 2016 audiences dancing in their seats. Equally enthralling were the glorious operatically trained voices of the lovers...\'The Golden Bride\' will give you a golden evening. I can’t imagine who wouldn’t enjoy this joy-filled production.""

The pacing and enthusiasm never lag; despite the obvious theatrics, we become fully engaged with the situations, recognizing both their outlandishness and their essential truth. Corny as it is, the ending will probably defeat your efforts to hold back the eye-faucets."" ', '""An enchanting production...A pitch-perfect 20-member cast performs the beautiful score, played by an excellent 14-piece orchestra...What’s so touching is how the production bridges the chasm, fusing Jewish music and American rhythms with themes that underscored the conflicts immigrants faced. ‘The Golden Bride’ is a time capsule, culturally and politically...This energetic musical is charming and poignant. The setting is Jewish, but the story speaks to everyone.” ', '“Notwithstanding the inconvenience of having to read the translations and, at times, even miss out on some of the details of the performance, and the lack of any meaningful political engagement, ‘The Golden Bride’ is brilliantly executed musical theater, overflowing with dozens of exceptionally talented actors and singers, and backed up by a very capable fourteen-piece, live orchestra...A wonderful, delightful, cheerful performance, free of politics, and well worth seeing.” ', '""With a luscious, eclectic score and a deliriously frivolous libretto, it provides a time capsule of the popular Yiddish musical entertainment of its day...A lavish production with 20 actors, an orchestra of 14, attractive sets, colorful costumes, evocative choreography and skillful direction that does not condescend to the material...Forget the plot and just relax and enjoy the great singing, dancing and comedy...The uniformly talented cast is blessed with some outstanding voices "" ', '""A summer treat to please audiences who love light theatrical nostalgia presented sincerely and sumptuously...This schmaltz is just an excuse for wonderful comedic shtick and lovely lilting songs performed spectacularly in Yiddish by a 20-member cast...To hear these numbers given the full-blown treatment they deserve is thrilling, with the leads delivering uniformly powerful vocals...No wonder audiences are eating up this effervescent entertainment like Eastern European comfort food.""

Though often artful, Rumshinsky\'s operetta has no high-art ambitions and shouldn\'t be misconstrued as having any...The plot resolutions of such shows were intended to provide nakhes (joy), not surprise...While \'The Golden Bride\' is up on its fast-stepping, endearingly feckless feet, you can still get a little taste of the delight that must have filled Kessler\'s Second Avenue Theater back in 1923."" ', '""The story itself, corny but charming, can easily be followed through the bursts of song and expressive performances by an excellent cast...Plot is not the operetta-style show’s strong point.

', 'for a previous production""The confection—with a lighter-than-air score, a charming libretto, and slyly funny lyrics—essentially takes period uptown romantic musical comedy tropes and transfers them to a milieu that would have appealed to Lower East Side audiences of the day. The result is a slightly loopy and always lovely-sounding show that also happens to be a great example of cultural appropriation...A top-notch physical production completes the picture for this sterling revisitation to \'Golden Bride.\'"" ', 'for a previous production""Delightful, visually beautiful, charming and lovely…I particularly loved that this show is being performed at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, which is mostly a museum dedicated to the Holocaust.

And the the whole crew does so with panache.""

That’s the question at the soulless heart of the Broadway musical centered on everyone’s favorite fictional ax-wielding ’80s antihero (Benjamin Walker, staggeringly good)...If you can resign yourself to the story’s innate ambiguity, you’re in for a perversely enjoyable experience. The script captures , and deftly skewers, all of the 1980s’ most over-the-top obsessions...Sheik’s bizarrely catchy, entirely electronic score plays like something blaring at Tunnel in 1989.""

', '""One problem is the story’s essential plotlessness...Lynne Page’s choreography makes excellent use of the 80s’ electro-pop club music that informs much of Sheik’s beat-heavy score, fun to hear but little of it more than momentarily memorable...Benjamin Walker walks the walk, talks the talk, looks the look, sings the songs, and dances the dances. Resistance to him, I’m afraid, is futile. This guy kills it.""

Goold and his book writer sometimes scrape the bottom, especially with the too easy references."" ', ""“Is it a first-rate musical? Not quite...But the show is a very sharp, distinctly theatrical treatment of its source material, in many ways improving on Mary Harron's movie version from 2000...Walker is charismatic and commanding, but it's the broken, corrosively conflicted aspects of his characterization that make the performance so hypnotic...Even with its flaws, the musical is a bloody good time.” "", '""There’s no heart but lots of blood in Duncan Sheik and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa’s witty musical treatment of the scandalous novel...Director Goold serves up the greedy ’80s vibe with knife-edge tech design and razor-sharp musical choices…The staging is consistently stylish, and the well-drilled ensemble work is consistently impressive. Nevertheless, the second act is disappointing. The humor is less manic, the songs less cutting, and, more critically, the violence is not violent enough.""

Somehow, it works.” "", ""“With its wicked wit, catchy ear candy and sexy cast, 'American Psycho' gives you a killer buzz—for a while...Director Rupert Goold’s staging boasts signature flash and style...The pace and interest slacken in the second act, when Bateman goes on a killing tear. The rampage generates as much terror as Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Minus a keen sense of danger, the show’s point is blunted...Through it all, handsome, hardbodied Walker hits all the right notes, seemingly without effort.” "", '“""A triumph of style over substance...The soullessness of consumerist capitalism in the Reagan era is well-captured...The whirling sets, hyperactive videos, bright lights and gaudy costumes eventually produced a feeling of sensory overload and a diminishing conviction that the story was worth all the effort involved. The second act loses some of the early energy. Nevertheless, as its best moments, the show’s style overcomes its flaws and makes for edgy entertainment.” ', '""The emptiness at the heart of \'American Psycho\' is the source of both its originality and its eventual tediousness.

', '""\'The Hello Girls\' is a historical musical which tells a little known story in a dramatic and compelling manner. Peter Mills\' score is tuneful without breaking with its 1917-18 time period. Cara Reichel\'s expert direction and a talented cast bring the many colorful characters to life. Prospect Theater Company\'s production of \'The Hello Girls\' deserves a longer life than this limited engagement Off Broadway run."" ', '""A musically rich, beautifully staged, and vibrantly performed musical...Reichel has assembled a terrific cast to deliver vivid performances...Just about perfect first act...The second act does have some problems, mainly the insertion of a scene and character that distract from the tone of the overall story...But enough quibbling. \'The Hello Girls\' is a first-class entertainment with strengths that far exceed any shortcomings.""

Inspired by real people..The action follows these five ‘hello girls’...With its rich score, assured staging and polished performances, the show reaches out and touches upon heroism of everyday women.” "", '""The show has been crafted with unusual skill. The music by Peter Mills is varied and often catchy, his lyrics are intelligent and the songs are well-integrated into the ambitious book by Mills and Cara Reichel...The fluid direction by Prospect’s producing artistic director Cara Reichel is a great asset...There is so much to admire here that I hope some clever producer finds an off-Broadway house for the show after it closes December 22.""   ', '""Mills and Reichel have illuminated a shadowy event in history at a time when women are again asserting themselves. The authors do this in true storytelling fashion without polemics so we sympathize with and care about protagonists.

The play harvests an engaging, upbeat and energized performance...The entire cast...has spunk...The clarity of the performance is palpable...Destined for a bigger stage, ‘Hello Girls’ might give us more space between vocal numbers and dramatic arc.” "", ""“A fascinating, stirring slice of early-twentieth-century women's history...Mills and Reichel tell their story with considerable verve...And without throwing any spurious, pro forma musical comedy romances into the mix, the authors depict the girls' growing friendships with their male colleagues and each other...Planting songs in just the right places and using them to strike exactly the right emotional notes...There are a few weaknesses here and there...But this is exhilarating entertainment.” "", '""A delightful tribute to the real-life women...What’s special about this production is that most of the cast members, in addition to providing affecting acting, play an assortment of musical instruments, and director Reich and choreographer Christine O’Grady keep the performers moving swiftly about the stage as the story unfolds...The musical numbers are catchy, and the lyrics are bright and intelligent...Winning performances and admirable creativity."" ', '""A new musical exploding with grrrl power, female camaraderie and uplifting songs...Ten quadruple-threat performers play all the parts and most of the instruments...Although the horrors of war are acknowledged, they are rarely dwelled on...\'The Hello Girls\' is painted in broad, sometimes sentimental strokes, but it is undeniably inspirational. When the cynic in you has an urge to roll your eyes, you may find them filled with tears."" ', '""Mills…provides 19 rousing, lyrically clever songs in a variety of modes from jazz to ragtime. Nearly every one works…Keeps reminding us of the chauvinistic obstacles the women had to overcome…\'The Hello Girls\' is good enough to warrant a commercial production; its chances would be even better with some smart trimming…Reichel\'s direction is perfection itself…Fishman\'s Grace is every inch the strong, independent leader the part requires, and she sings with assured authority."" ', '""With a focus on the terrifying war and the active societal equalizing of women, it’s a clever amalgam of something historically pertinent and something contemporarily pertinent...They’re fighting their own battle within the larger battle—and occasionally with humor...Since Mills writes strong, fluid melodies and those keenly crafted lyrics, the anthems and others are consistently tonic...Here’s a golden opportunity to get up to speed on Peter Mills. I’d say it’s all but imperative."" ', '""Ten talented actor-singer-musicians are filling the jam packed tiny stage...For Peter Mills’  lyrics are fresh and serve the story well, married to his music that is appealing  and often more than that.  As co-bookwriters he and Ms. Reichel have managed for the most part to deliver a very complicated story...There isn’t a weak link in the ten who fill the many roles...While the First Act is an unalloyed gem, in the shorter Act II there is a  tendency to contrive situations that don’t always ... ', '""Act One moves briskly, set in short scenes leading to Europe with an energetic ensemble of four talented women, skilled instrumentalists and singers...The flowing music is not as evocative of the period as, for example, \'Ragtime,\' but director/choreographer Cara Reichel adds lively dance steps to enhance the spirit of these intrepid women. Rather than relate solely to WWI, the music ranges forward into sounds of the 1920’s...The lyrics are notable, streetwise and conversational."" ', '""They’re all terrific—not only excellent actors but wonderful singers, dancers, and story-tellers. Lianne Arnold’s evocative set and projection design, Christine O’Grady’s choreography, and Ben Moss’s musical direction make this a rousing and enjoyable piece of theater, at least if you don’t analyze it too deeply. As you probably suspect, my critique centers on the politics, not the stage work—the latter is absolutely stellar."" ', '""All the performers are terrific especially Ellie Fishman as Grace Banker, leader of this band of sisters, who has great presence and a lovely voice...The music and lyrics by Peter Mills is often rousing, sometimes sentimental and just a little too repetitive although the intermingling of music and story is effective...Although there are arguments and misunderstandings between characters, the script lacks dramatic punch and its most powerful moment comes in the epilogue."" ', '""This is an enjoyable evening of significant theater...It is difficult to create any tension or element of surprise which affects the dramatic arc since so much of what happens is predictable especially in the first act...Hopefully the creative team will continue to hone the piece to produce a more concentrated story eliminating any irrelevant or repetitious material. It is still worth a visit to see this current production performed by an extremely talented cast.""  ', '""For the first act \'The Hello Girls\' is a rather thrilling thing — smart, human and sardonically feminist, with a lively ragtime-and-jazz score...Yet the freshness that’s so appealing in Act 1 dissipates in the bloated second act, which succumbs to sentimentality and broad-stroke cliché...We learn enough from the musical, which briefly sketches the women’s disgraceful treatment after the war, that it can’t get away with selling us a generically upbeat ending."" ', '""\'The Hello Girls\' contains everything a musical needs: potentially interesting characters, conflict, drama, melody, diversion, and message. It’s impressive. And it’s frustrating...They have an important story to tell, but Mills and Reichel stint on the character points that would make us care sufficiently...They’re more conduits for plot progression than people...Mills’s music has its pleasures...Despite its well-turned score, it struggles to feel like more than a tutorial.""

There is a fantastic balance between humor and heartache...Take yourself to \'The Outer Space\'–you won’t want to come back."" ', '“Sly, grumpy and just delightful…In numbers that lean on jazz, soul, funk and pop, Lipton turns his raspy tenor to clever rhymes…Do we really need another show in which a white guy vents his economic insecurity and foul mood? Turns out we do…This thumpingly humane show isn’t about getting away from it all or getting back to it all. It’s about learning to get over yourself, wherever you are, and adopting the small practices and habits that make you and yours a little happier.” ', '""Remarkably, Lipton is able to sustain this thinly veiled allegory through a gentle deadpan delivery. His dulcet growl is reminiscent of Garrison Keillor…At first glance, this jovial evening of story and song doesn\'t ask much, but if you listen closely, you\'ll notice that it brushes against the most personal of questions for New Yorkers: When will you admit that the rat race you found so intoxicating as a twentysomething is tiresome and fruitless?"" ', '""A charmer...I realize this probably sounds unbearably twee in the telling, right down to the William Accorsi-like rocket ship hanging over the stage. But in the performance by Ethan Lipton, who wrote the whole thing with Vito Dieterle, Eben Levy and Ian M. Riggs–brilliant instrumentalists who also add vocals–it’s ruefully hilarious and pretty irresistible."" ', '""Lipton charismatically carries us along this journey in a soft-spoken, NPR kind of way. His baritone vocals won’t blow the roof off of Joe’s Pub, but it’s a soothing, unique delivery that complements his band’s terrific musicality...Lipton is at ease under the direction of Silverman, who gently guides this mission to outer space and inner exploration...I’m not sure I was any closer to discovering \'the dream of letting go.\' But it was still worth the ride."" ', '""A funny, pointed, and strange story…‘The Outer Space’ makes something of an art form out of off-the-wall and out-of-left-field…In keeping with this approach, ‘The Outer Space’ is full of non-sequiturs and digressions. But these are funny non-sequiturs and digressions full of a kind of folksy urban social commentary…In short, ‘The Outer Space,’ helps the audience, just like that space-traveling couple, get away from it all, albeit just for 80 minutes or so.” ', ""“The show's musical numbers are an enjoyable, melodic mix of American styles— notably folk and soft rock. All are vibrantly delivered by Lipton and his back-up trio of musicians…It's the music and the musicians presenting it that make ‘The Outer Space’ an enjoyable theatrical ride…Mr. Lipton also has a wonderful way with words which is evident in his lyrics as well as his spoken dialogue…Silverman's direction enhances the flow between narrative and musical numbers.” "", '""Lipton is an oddly engaging performer, with a singing voice that hovers around a half-whisper and an endearingly understated comic sensibility...Lipton creates a charming fictional world...The success of \'The Outer Space\' hinges on Lipton’s unassuming charm, his chipper songs, and his endearing way of delivering them. Lipton is backed up by a very skilled set of musicians, who collaborated with Lipton on the score, but who nonetheless looked rather bored with the proceedings."" ', '""A funny, insightful allegory...Lipton’s songs are quirky delights. His rhymes are original and satisfying and his lyrics are joyful in their simple brilliance. Each time he sings, he employs a unique concept and executes it in a way that brings pleasure derived from experiencing truth and heartfelt wit...Occasionally the monologue part of the tale got a bit lengthy. The allegory wears a little thin...My only complaint about the show is the venue itself...I had to strain to hear the words.""

', '""Lipton’s witty imagining of outer space sounds less like the final frontier, and more like a pretty conventional suburban street, but the stage of Joe’s Pub is too small for anything too elaborate, so Lipton’s lyrics must marry instead to costume and scenic designer Zinn’s interplanetary-themed drapes, lit enchantingly by Ben Stanton...The songs are a warmly waspish marriage of the domestically mundane and the Space Age."" ', '""Lipton, as both writer and performer, still makes an excellent everyman, with nerdy honesty, gently acerbic wit, and sweetly sincere enthusiasm...The band is versatile and the songs well-crafted, drawing on elements of different American musical traditions...But polish has also smoothed off a few of Lipton’s spikier edges and more pointed critiques...The show is charming and genuinely funny but the commentary hits less hard...It’s a hopeful message–and one that feels a little oversimple."" ', '""\'The Outer Space\' looks and sounds pretty much like Lipton\'s previous entry, except this time the fellows are dressed in faux-astro jumpsuits...The collection of melodies is certainly a pleasant one, mixing various degrees of jazz, bluegrass and pop rock, and Lipton\'s whimsical lyrics and plainspoken vocals have a warm everyman attractiveness that draws a listener in, but \'The Outer Space\' merely orbits around its simple theme, with little gravitational pull of its own."" ', '“Dressed in a blue jumpsuit, Lipton delivers this tale with unassuming charm…But although it’s often clever, ‘The Outer Space’ gets trapped in too strict an orbit around its central joke: interplanetary travel as a metaphor for leaving the big city and moving to the country. By the time Lipton got to the pleasures of a Mercury Public Radio pledge drive, I found myself spacing out a bit."" ', '""It\'s probably not an entirely fair criticism to say that nothing really happens, but I doubt that Lipton cares about that...What starts out as an amusingly oddball evening becomes more and more like one of those Mercurian days, as the premise is stretched ever thinner. If you\'re already a Lipton fan, you\'ll find this to be an evening of gravity-free fun. If you prefer plots, characters, and tightly structured songs with perfect rhymes, don\'t blast off with this one.” ', '“The show is an attempt to recast Everyman issues in sparkling new terms…That\'s the direction in which Lipton is trying to head, but too much of what he does is setting our troubles against a different backdrop without much adaptation...More often than not the result feels fake and forced…The songs could elevate things, but they\'re constructed around the same down-to-Earth philosophy…This is exacerbated by the light, genial country flair of the music.""

It propels the stage in a symphony of movement...This is an important musical, in more ways than one, but it’s also fantastic entertainment.""

Wolfe's vision come to life, even more history is happening in Manhattan.” "", '""This show is, as the critics used to say, stupendous!...It’s not the story line you care about.

', ""“A refreshing burst of energy, no caffeine necessary...Glover’s rhythmic tap is the true pulse of ‘Shuffle Along’. The clickety-clacks heard from 30-plus dancers at once ignite every seat in the theater and quickly become the only beat we need, hold the orchestra...A dazzling production that celebrates art, dreams, and equality. And when the man behind me emphatically screamed out, 'Damn!' after the final number, I had to nod my head and agree.” "", '“As staged by Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Glover routines first performed nearly a century ago come across as defiantly fresh...What’s new in this \'Shuffle Along\' is the part written by Mr. Wolfe, and it’s what feels stalest...The clunky, shoehorned-in exposition doesn’t overwhelm the sweeping grace of ‘Shuffle Along’ whenever it sings or dances...Ms. McDonald is a one-woman time machine de luxe, who translates the precise stylistic quirks of a bygone era into a melting immediacy."" ', ""“It is cataclysmically entertaining...Glover’s thrilling choreography is enough alone to make the show worth seeing...Wolfe’s ambition to tell the story behind the musical...quickly starts feeling as if he were a PhD student defending his thesis about the significance of this 'sadly neglected' musical...Luckily, Wolfe the savvy showman often wins out over Wolfe the pedant, and there are moments of ‘Shuffle Along’ that are as electrifying and sublime as any this season on Broadway.” "", '""George C. Wolfe\'s combination of putting-on-a-show story and history lesson about the groundbreaking contributions of the \'Shuffle Along\' team to musical theater has so many riches that it\'s easy to forgive its somewhat disappointing execution of the \'All That Followed\' second act...Brilliantly choreographed by Savion Glover with a large, to-die-for, top-to-bottom cast...\'Shuffle Along\' is a most enjoyable, invigorating new look at a savory and worth thinking about slice of musical history."" ', '""Wolfe keeps the show moving energetically. It is the book, also by Wolfe, that I found wanting. The story of mounting a show against all obstacles seems clichéd...With five main protagonists, there is too little time to develop any of them very deeply…Nevertheless, you won’t find more talent on one stage anywhere else on Broadway. With all the book’s flaws, the story represents an important piece of theater history and black history that should not be forgotten."" ', ""“It's a thrilling kaleidoscope, both comfortable and unpredictable...Glover's work is electrifying, but the arrangements and orchestrations of Daryl Waters so meld together the musical bits and pieces into one seamless whole that they might be more amazing and integral...The second act, charting the 'All That Followed' chunk of the title, lacks the dynamic narrative thrust of the first, and struggles to maintain the same vibrancy, only regaining it in full for the finale.” "", '""A history lesson wrapped in a vivid theatrical entertainment wrapped in a rebuke...It may be too much, but you most definitely don’t want to live without it!...Wolfe stunningly recreates numbers from the show onstage and backstage, with the invaluable help of the magnificent tap choreography of Savion Glover...The show’s second act fares slightly less well, as it gives us more of a paint-by-numbers recap of the fates of these characters...Get tickets while they last."" ', '“A bold and wistful, playful and important musical-about-a-musical. It is overstuffed with ambition and talent, sure, but why shouldn’t it be?...There is a lot of exposition, a few too many back stories and, every so often, the narrative inertia of an illustrated history. But what illustrations these are, choreographed for the terrific dancing chorus by  Glover with both a combination of the dazzling, syncopated black-tapping tradition and his own special full-footed, stomping identity.” ', '""Witnessing the struggles and victories of the principal characters in \'Shuffle Along\' is exciting, not to mention mind-bogglingly entertaining...The collaboration of Wolfe and choreographer Savion Glover is inspired, although even they and their craft can’t quite relieve the heavy-handed story line and moralizing...The choreography is simply superb, not only recreating the era’s cheery virtuosity, but giving it a fresh, contemporary spin, performed by an expert, youthful cast."" ', '“Wolfe brilliantly explores important questions about race, power, and representation...While it’s easy to invest in the talented stars and the history they’re unearthing, ‘Shuffle’ is not necessarily character-driven, so when their personal fates become the focus, the results are somewhat less compelling. All the same…‘Shuffle’ itself feels like a long-overdue celebration — of Black artists and Black Broadway history.” ', '""\'Shuffle Along\' is for most of its overstuffed duration an exuberant entertainment. It’s also a social and show business lesson that’s told with unquestionable pride and elegant passion...The actors are totally engaging. Their immediate rapport with the audience is a large part of the show’s appeal...Choreographer Glover, one of the primary forces in modern tap, demonstrates he also understands the infectious joy of vintage combinations. His dances and the dancers are excitement incarnate.” ', '“This proudly flashy, impressively ambitious show is the very last production to open in the 2015-16 Broadway season. Talk about finishing on a high note...Sometimes bites off more than it can chew...After the rousing first act, the second act seems to meander...But what a dream team Wolfe has assembled here, and what unadulterated joy they evince at being able to perform together.” ', '“Act I is entertainment of dizzying heights. Act II plods with the usual heavy-handed dialogue that only George C. Wolfe can churn out. What a blissful, deliriously enjoyable and heavenly evening could have been achieved had the director Wolfe toned down the lugubriously preachy writings of writer Wolfe...However, the evening’s real hero is Savion Glover...In large part due to Mr. Glover’s vision, this heavy-handed musical soars into the stratosphere.” ', 'You love tap dancing Want to learn about history Like true stories', 'a fantastic show worth seeing', ""You love a good musical with a true story base.

Well, it does as exactly what it says on the tin, as they say...The upside - and this really knocked my bell-jingling socks off – is the enormous sound system that amplifies the live 16-piece orchestra...Hearing a Broadway score played out so richly at those increased volumes was quite spectacular.” "", '""\'Elf the Musical\' is your answer to reveling and rediscovering the Christmas spirit for you and your loved ones...Original songs will fill you with the Christmas spirit and have you humming the songs long after the show is over...Gratton\'s portrayal of the lovable elf captures an innocence and goofiness that is endearing, with the supporting cast rising to the occasion as well...New and old fans of the classic holiday story will enjoy this musical adaptation."" ', 'for a previous production""Meehan and Martin add their own comedic genius, creating a show that is funny and fun for the entire family. The writers succeed because they understand how to relate to today’s audience...Of course what really sets this show apart from the movie is that this is a musical...Thanks to the funny book, the energetic cast, and the bright and cheery costumes and sets, \'Elf The Musical\' is like a tasty sugar cookie with lots of colorful sprinkles on top."" ', 'for a previous production""The pacing can be frantic at times, but kids will enjoy \'Elf the Musical\'s\' peppy, upbeat musical numbers. There is plenty of (funny) adult humor that will probably go over the heads of youngsters under a certain age.  My only complaint with the musical is that leaves out one of my favorite scenes from the movie."" ', 'for a previous production""The book culls the best lines from the movie while also smartly managing to distinguish it as its own entity...The actors have the unenviable task of playing to the massive venue, which, in both look and feel, registers as more of an airplane hanger than the ideal spot for mounting musicals. Yet they do it with assurance, delivering unique and charming performances that, like the material itself, aren\'t carbon copies of their screen predecessors."" ', 'for a previous production""\'Elf the Musical\' is a funny fresh, treat for the holidays...The colorful sets and costumes were very visually appealing and the pace and plot of the show progressed very well. It is a unique show, and though you might think it is aimed at children because of the title, logo and look of the show, but I think the satiric humor caters best to teens and adults."" ', 'for a previous production""Being a fan of the film, but not wanting to just see a stage production mirroring the same thing I can see on DVD, I was pleasantly satisfied that \'Elf\' was able to keep the integrity of the plot, characters, and humor while, at the same time, giving each of those elements a fresh lift...By combining good music with loveable characters, a fun story, and a ton of holiday spirit, \'Elf\' is certainly worthy of becoming an annual family holiday tradition."" ', 'for a previous production""A high-octane song-and-dance version of the story of Buddy the Elf that has plenty to keep all ages entertained, from small children to seniors. Lacking the wryness and special effects of the film, this musical version nonetheless boasts a witty book which does develop, update and smooth over plot details that compress the story in a more genre-friendly way for the stage."" ', 'for a previous production""Although Blum delivers spritely spirit in song and dance, he can’t quite match Ferrell’s dazzling performance...The visual is candy coated cute. This show has strong principals...\'Elf the Musical\' is a fun way to get in the holiday mood. The elfin magic still charms even sans Ferrell."" ', 'for a previous production""The stage musical version, directed with a high dosage of energy by Sam Scalamoni, has much of the film’s charm and is geared more heavily toward families by playing up the holiday themes and opting for more family friendly humor...The show features a sugary sweet score of holiday-sounding ditties by Tony nominees Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin that start off a bit bland but steadily improve as the show moves along."" ', 'for a previous production""The creative talents behind the show have got some serious musical theatre chops...Their upbeat, oddball and tuneful concoction has a contemporary attitude that\'s light on the seasonal sentiment, but heavy on the showbiz fun...This production would be better suited for a smaller venue in a city where there\'s less competition from slicker holiday entertainments."" ', 'for a previous production""Certainly you hope a family show like this one will deliver a transformative experience for young theater-goers. This touring production of the musicalization of the 2003 feature film tries hard to do that, with a colorful, large scale production and a very solid cast – but while it gets off the ground and flies, it never really soars. Not in the way a feel-good family holiday story ought to, and there are many, many role models out there to serve as a guide to accomplish just that."" ', 'for a previous production""It\'s bright, it\'s tinkly, it has snow, it has a curmudgeon who gets his heart warmed, it has hustle and bustle, and Santa. In other words, the creators threw in every Christmas trope they could into the two and a half hour running time...They also keep the character development to a minimum, providing types rather than full-blown characters. The short-hand works, if only because of the simplistic nature of the piece - think a Muppet special, but with people."" ', 'for a previous production""If you feel like you didn’t get enough Christmas, you need not look any further than this high-energy show that’s running through early January. It’s so full of holiday cheer, it’s coming out its elven ears... A couple jokes seem to fall flat, barely eliciting a chuckle...But there more than plenty to laugh about...\'Elf The Musical\' is certainly a holiday treat. It just needs to cut back on the sugar."" ', 'for a previous production""Thankfully, the material is strong enough to stand on its own as a musical without its associated lead touring the country...Director Sam Scalamoni strikes a nice balance between the fantasy of the piece and the reality of a family being slowly ripped apart. Choreographer Connor Gallagher creates some clever original dances for the height challenged elf’s as well a beautiful ice skating sequence."" ', 'for a previous production""What I do wish was that this musical possessed just a little more silly. Don’t get me wrong, there are some good laughs here. But too much of the play feels like a reshaping of a comedy into a musical...\'Elf\' is recommended for families this Christmas season. I am not sure couples without kids will enjoy this as much, but if you are looking for a family friendly musical this is the one to go to."" ', 'for a previous production""\'Elf\' is not reinventing the form of the Broadway musical, nor does it have the earthy charm of \'A Christmas Story\'...This is not a show that will return you and your brood to a purer holiday era...But if you\'re looking for a big, glitzy, feel-good downtown show that is a good time, requires no cognitive investment whatsoever, has quite a few decent tunes and comes replete with broad appeal for everyone from 6-year-olds to seniors, \'Elf\' likely will exceed your expectations too."" ', 'for a previous production""This is not a perfect translation to stage of the sweet and charming movie that became a holiday classic...You do smile — even as you tamp down the feeling that this movie-to-stage musical was a blatant commercial attempt to cash in on the popularity of Ferrell\'s wildly popular performance...Still, this is a talented cast."" ', 'for a previous production""The musical mostly avoids disappointment, travelling in the range between benign and fairly charming...Where Ferrell was all deadpan innocence and incredulousness as Buddy, Blum\'s characterization is more Chris Kattan: He\'s the Spirit of Christmas Spazzy...The show as a whole doesn\'t creep far above nice, really, but that\'s far preferable to naughty."" ', 'for a previous production""\'Elf The Musical\' isn’t likely to become a Christmas tradition for everyone.  The musical numbers are polished and pretty, but not particularly memorable... Buddy’s infectious spirit at the front of the show turns grating as his romp across New York carries on...All told, \'Elf The Musical\' is a great piece of theater to share with the little ones  around Christmas. But, if you have a touch of the Grinch already, you may want to steel yourself with an eggnog or two before coming out."" ', 'for a previous production""\'Elf\' seemed a little lost onstage, its sets flimsy, its good cheer not quite infectious. In Eric Petersen, it can claim a particularly spirited and winning Buddy…There is generally fine work from everyone else, even the elf chorus, whose members must perform several numbers on their knees...The children in the audience seemed most delighted by a number that climaxed in confetti cannonry."" ', 'for a previous production""The stage version, that is now on the stage at The Cadillac Palace Theatre, as part of the Broadway In Chicago season, is a festive and cute holiday entertainment, and although the star, Will Blum is very close to Ferrell, the musical version falls a little flat... I found this show to appear as one might see in a Community Theater. Our local Community Theater would never touch this show, but if they did, it would far surpass what is on the stage at The Cadillac Palace."" ', 'for a previous production""Will Blum is an energetic and capable performer, so it’s hard to put a finger on exactly why he’s a poor fit for the title character of \'Elf the Musical.\' The chief issue: Instead of emphasizing the innocent, childlike nature of a 28-year-old who thinks Santa is real, Blum occasionally inches towards the creepy...\'Elf’s\' frequently two-dimensional, gaudy sets from Christine Peters lend an amateur feel to some of the show’s scenes."" ', 'for a previous production""Director Sam Scalamoni’s production, with a lot of flat scenery by Christine Peters, is visually chintzy in its renderings of North Pole workshops and Manhattan skylines. It’s hard to describe the performances when the enterprise is so cartoonish; the actors all seem capable, yet they rarely get an opportunity to display much personal appeal...The show might not want to be anything more than a big silly toy, but it doesn’t spin. It’s wound too tight.""

Miss You Like Hell,"['""The diversity of its ensemble and storylines is organic and unforced, and its political timeliness does not feel opportunistic. This highly anticipated musical is a gem...Erin McKeown’s score is varied and moving...\'Miss You Like Hell\' sets the bar for what a feminist piece of theater can be. Hudes’ writing is brave and deliberate...The connection between the two leads is palpable; any scene that involves their explosive interactions is spellbinding."" ', '""Hudes\'s characters are authentic and their multi-layered conflicts are believable and connect easily to the important issues...Powerful and emotionally engaging lyrics and music that...provide deep insights into the characters...Debessonet directs with a fluidity that allows her cast to discover the nuances of their characters and their relationships to one another...Not grounded in sentimentality but in the strength derived from connection to culture...Not to be missed."" ', '""The only new musical with songs approaching the insight and power of McKeown’s is \'The Band’s Visit\'...If it lacks the intricate harmonic, key, and rhythmic shifts of Yazbek’s music, the story is much more forthright, and ultimately heartbreaking...Hudes\' book takes no time to warm up...Any Rubin-Vega performance is going to be big and hyper-intense. Jimenez matches that energy from the get-go...DeBessonet’s direction is nearly as tireless as her two heroines."" ', '""""Has a timely political edge, an ethnically diverse cast and a score by a singer-songwriter who knows how to rock. What\'s more, it\'s good-really good...Steers a bit erratically between sentiment and sentimentality, but it scarcely ever descends to outright tearjerking and Ms. McKeown’s score heightens every emotion so skillfully that you’d think this was her third or fourth show instead of her theatrical debut."" ', '""Refreshingly original...Rubin-Vega plays the overbearing, over-caring Beatriz exceptionally well...Her performance in songs like \'Over My Shoulder\' is relevant and heartbreaking...Jiménez is perfectly irritating in her portrayal of Olivia...The wide variety of musical presentation in \'Miss You Like Hell\' keeps the show alive...Relevant and well-written, this new musical takes on a complicated story with great success, and its vibrant music will stay with audience members long after they exit."" ', '""Powerful and super relevant show...This topical and smart musical wraps itself up in a sweet yet engaging road trip that is driven with perfection by the star and her director, Lear deBessonet...It\'s a raw and challenging story, laced with moments of struggle and acceptance as Rubin-Vega\'s mother Beatriz tries her best to \'mommy the fuck out\' of her girl...It feels so real and touching, just like the whole of this musical piece, causing the tears to flow down my cheeks."" ', '""A lovely and touching chamber musical...With a powerful singing voice and acting skills that mix teenage angst with the anger of a troubled soul who felt forced into early adulthood, Gizel Jiménez is a formidable Olivia...While the detours can get a little sluggish,\' Miss You Like Hell \' is gripping stuff when focused on Beatriz and Olivia, especially with Rubin-Vega and Jiménez giving such strong performances. And its topicality adds to the impact."" ', '""A touching, lively musical...The show taps strongly into contemporary concerns...The beauty of the show, enhanced by the lead performances, is how well the songs are integrated into the plot and how effectively supporting characters are brought into the story...deBessonet integrates story and music smoothly...Despite some weak spots here and there, this is a work with originality and heart and appearing just at the right time.""

It\'s replete with the kind of songs you want to hear again, a uniformly outstanding ensemble led by two remarkable performers, and...driven by a subject of immediate public concern…However, her play is really schmaltz-porn about an estranged mother and daughter\'s reconciliation…Rubin-Vega...the intensity of a tropical hurricane."" ', '""Rubin-Vega once again lends her magnetic persona and powerful voice, and the lovely and golden-voiced Gizel Jiménez is very much a star in the making...Using the template of the road trip...provides the show with some amusing as well as scary encounters. Unfortunately, some of work better than others...Even though the mother-daughter interchanges aren\'t flawless, the scenes in which anger, regrets and love unfold are the most satisfying...Moving and worth seeing.""

In addition, the direction of Lear deBessonet is compelling and vibrant...What is not so compelling or vibrant is the story and the music...It was the performers\' mastery that charmed the audience. The story has holes the size of craters...The sincerity and dynamism is packed tight into this troop and the musicians who accompany them. They explode onstage."" ', '""Full of exuberance and heart and good intentions...At times a bit too reminiscent of a cloying show like \'Up With People\'...the ensemble members back up the songs with gusto and without the aid through most of the show of anything resembling a set...McKeown and Hudes offer poetic lyrics that serve as counterpoint to the snappy, street-smart dialogue. To their credit, \'Miss You Like Hell\' ultimately refuses to submit to the uplift that theatergoers have come to expect from a musical."" ', '""\'Miss You Like Hell\' does not become poignant until it is almost over when the stakes are raised and Olivia realizes that she could lose her mother if she is deported...Quiara Alegría Hudes and Erin McKeown have created a timely story in their investigation of the life of an undocumented immigrant but ultimately \'Miss You Like Hell\' avoids much of the possible drama in the way it doles out bits and pieces of Beatriz\'s story."" ', '""Sometimes the only way to repair a parent-child rift is a long, literal (and metaphorical) drive...Their slow reconciliation is achieved in large part by singing the lively songs Hudes and McKeown have written -as well as some of the less irresistible ones...Perhaps most responsible for the tuner\'s alluring effect is director Lear deBessonet...Rubin-Vega is an angst-ridden, determined, hopeful firecracker. In other words, she’s doing what she always does best."" ', '""How a 16-year-daughter who hasn\'t seen her mother in four years could serve as a plausible character witness is one of the weakest plot points...Rubin-Vega and Jimenez are both quite strong in their roles. The music by McKeown, in a variety of generic styles, is serviceable...I really wanted to like it, but was disappointed that it did not offer any real illumination on the many issues it touched on...Most of the audience seemed quite enthusiastic."" ', '""The show is quite a tearjerker when it sticks to the fraught mother-daughter relationship at its core, with tuneful folk-rock songs that touch on depression, heritage and family. But after hitting a few bumps on the highway, Hudes’s book loses focus and crashes into cliché...It’s a treat to spend time with complex Latinx characters who buck stereotypes. But although \'Miss You Like Hell\' takes us on a resonant journey, its trajectory needs adjusting.""  ', '""New musical unlike few I\'ve seen: by women and about women of color...While the music is enjoyable and beautifully orchestrated, and both the staging by Lear deBessonet and design are smart, the overall show feels too muted and diffuse...I wanted to feel more about these characters and their predicament...This admirable musical could use some more tuning, and future life beyond the Public, because it is a story about real characters we need to see and hear from onstage."" ', '""The show packs a blazing performance by Daphne Rubin-Vega, some fresh songs by Erin McKeown, and a fast, fluent staging by director Lear deBessonet. Then there’s this ultra-serious story...The playwright\'s troubled mother-daughter story proves to be merely a half-bad component...McKeown, a folk-rock songwriter making her theater debut here, has crafted a likeable collection of songs that are more about rhythms than rhymes in their composition and appeal."" ', '""Admirable, full-hearted, and underwhelming...Lacks a sense of magic...Songs to Hudes and McKeown’s credit, help fuel the narrative rather than merely embellish it. Ironically, given the weighty issues addressed, the most compelling tunes are the gentler, breezier ones...For all its flaws, \'Miss You Like Hell\' appeals genuinely and sometimes movingly to our sense of compassion and capacity for hope; you just wish the musical were as transcendent as the message."" ', '""The unambiguous reason to see this new musical is Gizel Jimanez...\'Miss you like hell\' never delivers the promised emotional payoff, largely because the characters are so thinly sketched...Instead of using the road-trip format to reveal more about Olivia and Beatriz, the book\'s author adopts a picaresque approach, populating the play with characters who arrive, steal focus, and then drop out of the story...I left the theatre wanting to know so much more about these characters."" ', '""As long as it sticks to the story of a mother-daughter relationship...it is a powerful example of what musicals do best: explore the unprotected border where individual needs and social issues intermix...Too often falls short of its own ambitions...Too much time is turned over to diversions apparently meant to be distracting or, worse, heartwarming...Rubin-Vega, with her rough charisma, and Jiménez, with her blue-sky voice, generally make you forget all that."" ', '""Smart, if a bit on the nose, and with a less generic score and more trenchant direction, \'Miss You Like Hell\' might really start to flex its muscles. But McKeown\'s songs evaporate from the brain pretty quickly, and deBessonet is so invested in the poignancy of the story that she never really finds its edges...There\'s power to its central plot, and to Rubin-Vega\'s and Jiménez\'s performances...But this car trip sticks to such well-worn emotional terrain, it loses its sense of adventure."" ', '""An earnest show that too often gets stuck in a traffic jam of multiple themes, characters and storylines...Overstuffed with ideas and incidents that don\'t add up to a sweeping, satisfying whole...The human touches of the mother-daughter dynamic are the most appealing part of the show...Low-tech to a fault...However, McKeown makes an impressive stage debut with music that is eclectic and appealing, though the lyrics are too often an odd mix of fleeting grace and awkwardness."" ', '""This timely show addresses such hot-button societal issues...But in an effort to be as entertaining as impactful, it does so in a cutesy, cloying manner that undercuts the important messages being imparted...Hudes\' episodic book shifts wildly in tone, consistent only in its inconsistency and lack of credibility, while McKeown\'s pop-rock score features unmemorable ditties...The 10-person ensemble works hard to bring heart to the material, and they often succeed.""

(2015) A Child's Christmas in ...,"['""A lively production which awakens the youthful spirit of joy in each of us...The production touched my heart and brought me back to my own Christmases with generations of family...The Irish Rep production is refreshing...For that reason this holiday classic is a superb seasonal show that kids old and young will appreciate."" ', '""In addition to celebratory sequences, several spooky incidents are depicted with the cast gleefully performing as if they were children. Michael Gottlieb’s cheery lighting design appropriately turns moody and sinister...The appealing cast’s charming presence combined with the beautifully dressed stage makes this \'A Child’s Christmas in Wales\' look and feel like an idealized family gathering. Seeing this production is a delightfully comforting way to spend time during the holiday season."" ', '""You don\'t even really have to pay close attention to Thomas\' prose to absorb the warmth of his nostalgic tales of Christmases past. Just let it warm you inside like a cup of hot cocoa and take in the spirit of the holidays that exist only in our fantasies and fabricated memories...This fantasy world is the capital of all holiday fare, and \'A Child\'s Christmas in Wales\' lets us spend a luscious 70 minutes inside."" ', '""Its devotion to faith and family makes it a gingerbread-scented charmer and, in its own special way, the perfect little Christmas show...Sprawling swaths of Thomas remain, largely unscathed, to anchor the reminiscences, and that\'s where most of the show\'s heft is found. But when they fuse most seamlessly, particularly during a late caroling session that doesn\'t quite go as planned, the effect is amusing, affirming, and original beyond merely the words on the page."" ', '""Without Dickens’s eye and ear for extreme emotional and fiscal predicaments, the story’s more fantastic moments wouldn’t have the weight of truth...Thomas’s script affords actors the opportunity to emote through speech rather than behavior; the words are their gestures...The reality that Thomas and Wilder offer us is filtered through memory and the self-absorption that comes with being—and the music that comes with it, too."" ', '""What makes the production so appealing is its quiet and elegant simplicity. We are drawn almost unconsciously into the tale...It’s a testament to Thomas’s writing that many of the scenarios presented can be seen as comical in one light and a bit tragic in another. One of the most striking things about \'A Child’s Christmas in Wales\' is that no matter how many times we may see it, we can always find something different in its telling."" ', '""This sweet and modest show conjures plenty of good will toward men...The descriptions of treats and toys are evocative, the carols appealingly sung, the cast charming."" ', '""The mood is nostalgic without ever getting gooey...This production couldn’t be more agreeably comfortable with just enough \'literature\' for the adults and jolly carols for the kids. All the performers sang and acted perfectly and were convincing as a troupe that not only liked entertaining, but liked each other as well."" ', '""The prose, with its stories of odd relatives visiting for the holiday, descriptive language of snow falling and childhood fun and remembrances, is interlaced with Christmas songs both moving and filled with good cheer...A highlight in the 20-plus song repertoire is Cullum\'s solo...The 75-minute, no-intermission presentation has such a warm, nostalgic feel, that you\'ll wish Christmas didn\'t come just once a year."" ', '""Robinson has an effortless charm that makes these words seem real as if they are coming from your own memories. Jacque Carahan, Danielle Erin Rhodes have the character roles such as Thomas’ drunken aunt. Katie Fabel is the love interest. John Cullum is the patriarch here and when he is on he is good. Equipped with a script he still gets lost so we feel as if we are in a under rehearsed production."" ', '""On one level, the reverie seems lovely, however staid. Closer scrutiny, however, reveals something much more disturbing: in conjuring up a simpler, but more sexist and heteronormative world...This makes \'A Child’s Christmas in Wales\' nostalgic, sweet, and highly unrealistic. In fact, despite pleasurable moments of music and jest, the play is essentially an artifact of a time best forgotten or left to historians to analyze, critique, or parse for meaning."" ', 'for a previous production""It’s extremely unlikely that there’s a friendlier, warmer or more rewarding hour to be found on any New York stage...The rich, evocative beauty of \'A Child’s Christmas in Wales\' thrives comfortably alongside the jokes and the bumptious family memories of holiday excess. The Rep actors do a particularly good job of rooting out the truth and the genuine depth of feeling lying at the throbbing heart of this tenderly gorgeous little masterpiece of familial foibles."" ', 'for a previous production""In the Rep’s show traditional and modern Christmas standards compete to cast a seasonal spell over even the most resisting natures from songs that are high on melody and five part harmony, and low on sentiment. Take yourself along to blow away the winter blahs, and be assured it will be worth every penny...The talented ensemble are all note perfect from start to finish, and the 70 minutes of sheer entertainment is pure joy."" ', 'for a previous production""The show will be too abstract for very young children, but at only 90 minutes (with one intermission), \'A Child’s Christmas in Wales\' is an ideal holiday show for older kids, who will be drawn especially to David Millman, the young actor who plays Dylan as a boy...Kids of every age will immediately see themselves in him...\'A Child’s Christmas in Wales\' is that perfect snowflake falling down to the tip of your tongue. Catch it before it’s gone."" ', 'for a previous production""This production really put me in the holiday spirit. With creative staging inspired by Charlotte Moore’s adaptation for the Irish Repertory Theatre, and featuring a diverse and talented cast, we get a peek into what a typical Christmas may have been like for young Dylan in 1928. The story is charming, the cast highlights Thomas’s prose by performing many well-known and beloved Christmas carols throughout the 90 minute show."" ', 'for a previous production""My question was how could the Irish Rep inject enough dramatic tension into this sweet story to make of it a play? Amazingly well...It brings home the whole point of the Christmas tradition. "" ', 'for a previous production""Thomas is precise, efficient, and daring...This is writing that needs no explanation, adjustment or augmentation. Yet this is precisely what Charlotte Moore has chosen, with the best of intentions, to do. She has added not only Christmas carols and songs but swaths of text as well...The very clear result is that you will either like it or you won’t. Much of the audience did on the night I attended with several audible sighs after sentimental songs and plenty of laughs where they were intended."" ', 'for a previous production""It retains Thomas’s text but adds enough traditional and contemporary Christmas music to make the 1952 classic feel fresh again. And with renowned actor Howard McGillin leading the five-member cast, the show becomes as good as a striped and colored peppermint stick. The ensemble’s enjoyment of what they are doing is not only engaging, but their genuine enthusiasm becomes infectious."" ', 'for a previous production""I know it’s blasphemy, but I’m not really one for \'Silent Night,\' probably from overkill at this time of year. Here, I liked it...In another sense, if the show feels like a homecoming, it may be because you’ve  seen several of the actors involved in the production in your theatregoing over the years...For people ready to unplug the Christmas machinery, here’s a simple, yet festive, way to get into the holiday spirit."" ', 'for a previous production""Director/adapter Charlotte Moore’s concert version is actually a little too overdressed, at least with music...at times the musical treacle becomes too thick, with the performers belting out traditional carols like \'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\' with forced jollity. All told, though, it’s a charming 70-minute holiday diversion. By the end, when you’re invited to sing along to Christmas tunes, you’ll find it hard to resist."" ', 'for a previous production""They sing as if they\'re welcoming you into their living room, and you can\'t help but smile...More than any one moment, though, \'A Child\'s Christmas\' is a wash of emotion, transporting us to the white dusted mountains of the famously tragic poet\'s youth when he was just a boy who built snow castles."" ', 'for a previous production""\'A Child\'s Christmas in Wales\' is high on sentiment and low on surprise...His winding and sing-song sentences conjure not only an idyllic Christmas past but also an awareness of the hazy gloss required to keep memories fond. The cast members\' cheerfulness and the constant interruption of the carols, however, keep any sadder implications from blighting the show\'s merry sheen."" ', 'for a previous production""For a light holiday diversion, you can\'t get much lighter than the Irish Repertory Theatre\'s concert adaptation of Dylan Thomas\' \'A Child\'s Christmas in Wales\'...Running a swift 75 minutes, this confection emphasizes the sentiment and the saccharine...The evening ends with a medley of familiar Christmas songs sending the audience out into the cold. It\'s a bracing and straightforward finish to an overly sweet holiday celebration."" ', 'for a previous production""A sweetly festive holiday show, but one that would greatly benefit from a stronger visual production than Charlotte Moore\'s simple staging...In the end, though, these ditties, along with the rest of the songs performed here, would best be left to a recording of this tale to be enjoyed in pajamas by a toasty fireplace."" ', 'for a previous production""It’s hard to begrudge a crew of nattily dressed Christmas carolers the unavoidable saccharine they’re bound to generate while performing their duties, but it’s possible...The short, unassuming production is clearly a labor of love, but this is a family show overburdened with dense period arcana that will sail over the heads of most in the audience...Still, there’s something to be said for the utter purity of intention Moore and company bring to the show.""

They roared their approval at every triumph."" ', '""It’s a musical about female empowerment as two women battle innate powers to find their own strength in each other. Director Michael Grandage takes this seriously and finds Shakespearean echoes in the material. There’s also plenty of wit on display in the songs of husband and wife team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Grandage is incredibly well-served by a cast of terrific actors and singers...It has a clear narrative drive and is full of heartache."" ', '""Disney sails a steady course where humanity succeeds over mere effect and good old-fashioned theatricality triumphs over any temptation to overdo the technology. Oh, and it has a pretty flawless cast to boot...Grandage’s skill lies in recognising that in order to finesse some fairly subtle and weighty points...He is aided by Lee’s shapely book and Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez’s feel-good music and lyrics...Worth every penny of its ticket price."" ', '""Ashford and Grandage have transformed a 41-member cast into a smoothly coordinated theatrical organism...\'Frozen\' is an eye-popping illustration of what contemporary stage technology can achieve...But the physical production never overshadows the performances of an impressive company...This visually rich, wonderfully paced, aurally thrilling production keeps us wide-eyed and on tenterhooks for more than two hours, even when we know how things are going to end.""  ', '""For those who have approached past Disney musicals with subtle skepticism, \'Frozen\'\'s sweeping theatricality, diverse casting, and message of female empowerment is a blast of crisp, wintry air...Once the spell is cast and the adventure begins, things lighten up significantly in the reflective sunshine of frozen Arendelle. Audiences can expect magical flourishes throughout...\'Frozen\' works hard to keep balance on its theatrical ice...Its message of sisterly love is refreshingly heartwarming.""

', '""The music is by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, who wrote seven brilliant songs for the movie and added 12 ordinary new ones to the stage version...Offers plenty of entertainment, but it doesn’t have any of the unique genius that Taymor brought to \'The Lion King\' or the creativity we enjoyed in other Disney ventures...What it does sport is something a bit different: a serious stirring story of a strong sister relationship...The story\'s creativity gets weakened."" ', '""Invention and dynamic wonderment isn’t going to be found under the standardized snowy landscapes of director Michael Grandage’s creation...All the main ingredients are present though...In Murin’s portrayal, the piece finds its connection and attachment, falling in love with her goofiness and sense of wonder...A purely serviceable Disney adaptation of the most successful animated movie of all time."" ', '""The score is generally tuneful but often generic…Levy is ideal as the ice princess and Murin outstanding as her estranged, but valiant sister, each ringing a bell of sorts for female empowerment…Not on my list of favorites is the show\'s hokey, heavy-footed, overlong book...True love thaws icy hearts and everyone lives happily ever after…Even with its darker, adult-oriented psychological hues, and an unexpected character turnaround, too much of \'Frozen\' remains icebound."" ', '""A perfectly lovely Broadway musical by the standards of every other producer, but we go into a Disney show wishing upon a star for more...Jennifer Lee smartly adapts the story for the stage...None of these songs have quite the impact of the surefire showstopper \'Let It Go\'...There\'s nothing groundbreaking about \'Frozen\'...Stage snow, glory notes, and an unforgettable quick change. What more could you want from a Broadway show? Perhaps it really is dangerous to dream for more.""   ', '""Want to know the real star of \'Frozen\'? That would be Sven, the reindeer...He is pure theatre and pure magic...\'Frozen\' is a good show. With its music, its dance, its flurry of likable leads...it offers most of the pleasures that we count on Broadway musicals to provide...It rarely feels like more than the movie and sometimes it feels like less...\'Frozen\' could be more inventive, more imaginative, more vital, more necessary. But as those little girls would almost certainly say, let it go.""

Yes. Does it matter? Probably not...Mostly director Michael Grandage rests the tale on the shoulders of the two actresses playing Elsa and Anna, and they come through with loving, heartfelt performances.""

There are, however, some delightful additions...Most of the 12 new songs written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are introspective and dark, and meant to deepen our understanding of the characters...A work that captures a lot of what was delightful about the film, while giving us a bit more to think about.""

', '“The show is small and hasn’t much on its mind, just the urge to put a few likable characters through a simple story and send its audience out with a collective feeling of ‘Aww.’ Thanks to an attractive production and an overqualified cast, it gets its ‘Aww,’ though it also earns a couple of helpings of ‘You can’t be serious’…No world-beater, then, but if all you want is a modern-day, reality-based fairy tale with an eagerness to please and nice people to root for, look no further.” ', ""“It's corny, contrived, conventional, and clichéd, but like most innutritious fast food, it goes down without heavy chewing…All would be forgiven if only Jennifer Robbins's book weren't quite so simplistic (one of its biggest laughs depends on the mispronunciation of 'vegan'), and Dan Martin (music) and Michael Biello's (lyrics) otherwise sprightly score so generic…'Marry Harry' is a lightweight, edible, 80-minute pasta fazool that makes the most of its high-calorie ingredients.” "", '""Couldn’t be much sweeter than it is without requiring insulin shots...As it is, \'Marry Harry\' is a one-act that would benefit from filling in...Certainly, Biello could do some work on the lyrics, which from time to time count for charm too much on things like la-las...Castellino directed and choreographs well, if occasionally excessively.

', '""There’s not much memorable from Robbins’ book, which crams in more plot points than ingredients in your mother’s lasagna. The score, too, while occasionally catchy, won’t leave you with ditties to hum out of the theatre. But what is worth seeing are the two charming performances by Wolpe and Spadora as father and son. Together, as well as individually, they’re able to bring an endearing sense of humanity to the overloaded script."" ', '“‘Marry Harry,” which basically gives up its plot in its title, wants to be the latest wrinkle in romantic musicals. Unfortunately, its plot and its characters are a little too thin to sustain an entire show. It also uses one gimmick to death. On the other hand, it offers a good argument for proving that young people should not work for their parents and that when it is time to move out, they should work to change their lives.” ', '""The plot is one-note...Still, this production is fairly family-friendly...The show has welcome touches of whimsy...Jennifer Robbins’s book, Michael Biello’s lyrics and Dan Martin’s music have moments of wit, but mostly each song has one simplistic statement to make...In \'Newly Wed,\' Francine is thrilled that her daughter is about to tie the knot; at one point she actually skips around the stage while singing, \'Tra-la-la.\' The message doesn’t get any more nuanced."" ', '""Everything about it looks great: the outfits, the decor, the lighting—but there\'s no avoiding the fact that Jennifer Robbins\' book and Michael Biello\'s lyrics aren\'t worth the effort...The joy of this production is the way it embraces its ludicrousness...As a director, Castellino combines these various ingredients with zest..If only the material all this inventiveness is lavished on had the same charm. Instead, it clunks with clichés."" ', '""The idea of a romance between two young people who are overly tied to their single parents is a decent jumping-off point, but Robbins\' book is so slapdash that one quickly grows tired of these people and their contrived problems. That \'Marry Harry\' is meant to be a light entertainment is no excuse...If everyone involved had written a show that was as witty and ebullient as the scenic design, the York might have had something really good on its hands."" ', '""Old-fashioned is too fresh an adjective for the musty musical rom-com...Sparks, complications and hoary humor fly, but it’s all de trop—or, more precisely, tropes...Dan Martin and Michael Biello’s songs are pleasant but unmemorable...Jennifer Robbins’s tepid, low-stakes book causes indigestion...Director-choreographer Castellino works hard to turn this TV dinner into a gourmet meal, but his swift and inventive staging can only do so much...Marry Harry?

', 'for a previous production""This show is a riot and MUST SEE for musical theater fans...It’s a love letter to musical theater with samplings of famous show tunes scattered throughout."" ', 'for a previous production""\'Something Rotten\' is simply false advertising. Something Absolutely Brilliant would be closer to the mark, but I imagine modesty prevented those involved from telling the truth about this parody. It is, quite simply, the best musical I have seen in ages."" ', 'for a previous production""Nicholaw’s genius for reducing an audience to helpless giggles is on blazing display in Something Rotten! — a new show so steeped in the tradition that it often seems like a concordance. Anything you’ve ever liked in a musical comedy (and a few things you haven’t) are here, just waiting to sing-and-dance you into submission...It’s total silliness, of course; Nicholaw keeps the lights bright, the sound loud, and the plot moving at a furious boil. (That’s part of why it evaporates so quickly.)"" ', 'for a previous production""There is absolutely nothing rotten about the new musical \'Something Rotten!\' In fact, I smell a hit. Right out of the Mel Brooks school of comedy, nothing is sacred and everything is funny! ""Something Rotten” is red meat for theatre lovers – it’s clever, bodaciously funny, ridiculously tuneful; and even if Act II feels a bit overdone, audiences are sure to eat it up."" ', 'for a previous production""“Rotten!” paints musical theater culture in the same broad strokes that the “The Book of Mormon” used to satirize religion—everyone gets to be in on the joke. This new musical makes us do just enough work that we feel satisfied for picking up on them. Go for the production numbers and the big-hearted turns from the leads, whose enthusiasm ultimately proves even more infectious than the plague."" ', 'for a previous production""Its greatest achievement is combining all these elements and transcending parody because of how openly it wears its heart on its sleeve, it’s a show by musical lovers made to please other musical lovers...A blissfully entertaining show that doesn\'t pretend to contain anything particularly original."" ', 'for a previous production""A delightfully irreverent mash-up of Broadway musicals and Shakespeare that should keep audiences laughing for years to come...The love stories are slight. But director Casey Nicholaw compensates. He’s an expert at staging broad comedy without letting his cast resort to hamminess…It’s the writers, all making their Broadway debuts, who emerge as the biggest stars, imbuing \'Something Rotten!\' with smart-alecky glee."" ', 'for a previous production""Seldom does the Great White Way see a sillier version of the highbrow and a smarter version of the lowbrow in one show. The laugh-a-minute book by Kirkpatrick and O’Farrell, observes all the conventional structure of the musical comedy genre, but transports it to a level of unadulterated fun not achieved often enough...Nicholaw moves the whole production in a seamless, happy-go-lucky whirlwind, which barely allows for the audience to stop laughing."" ', 'for a previous production""It\'s like Monty Python for Shakespeare. The show is nothing substantial, it\'s fluff- hilarious fluff. If you like Spamalot you\'re going to like this show.""  ', 'for a previous production""A rare theatrical event…a wonderful musical farce.  Anyone who wants to go to the theatre and have a great time, unburdened by a complicated plot, listen to fun lyrics, and experience two acts of non-stop laughter…this “very new musical” should be their play of choice!"" ', 'for a previous production""\'Something Rotten!\' doesn\'t quite reach the game-changing heights of that blockbuster musical, but it will give you two and a half hours of hearty laughs...that the show is able to maintain its high level of lunacy without falling into a disappointing rut in the second act is a testament to Nicholaw, his cast, and his creative team."" ', 'for a previous production""Shamelessly silly parody of Broadway musicals — an outrageous spoof of all things Shakespeare...Although comic desperation descends on the second act, it’s still a deliriously funny show."" ', 'for a previous production""Musical theater aficionados will eat up the constant tongue-in-cheek references, not just to Shakespeare\'s works and characters, but to musicals generally. That said, not every joke is a home run. Those who don\'t attend the theater as often won\'t ""get"" all the insider references. What they will get is a terrific cast performing at the top of their game, peppy direction and choreography, and lots of colorful and varied design work."" ', 'for a previous production""Supremely silly...the musical love child of “The Carol Burnett Show” and “Forbidden Broadway.” In other words, this showbiz offspring has some darn fine DNA. And a terrific core idea...And the formula works — mostly. Some tunes and dance pieces recur. So laughs dry up as “Something Rotten!” becomes a deju vu-sical. There’s compensation, though, including a mouthwatering production that looks like more than a million bucks."" ', 'for a previous production""Casey Nicholaw pulls out every trick in the theatrical book to keep you from laughing so hard and smiling so much you’re likely to overlook the show’s flaws until you’ve left the theater...yet, for all of its high points, something is missing from the show – a real heart."" ', 'for a previous production""The new musical \'Something Rotten!\' offers something rare, as well as something recycled. The something rare is the opportunity for no fewer than three leading men to astonish us in entirely different ways...“Something Rotten!” turns into something recycled. “Omelette” tells the story of “Hamlet” by riffing on “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Les Miserables,” “Pippin,” “Annie,” and any other number of tuners."" ', 'for a previous production""Smells like a hit, a very palpable hit...This is a big, brash meta-musical studiously fashioned in the mold of Monty Python\'s Spamalot, The Producers and The Book of Mormon, loaded with crowd-pleasing showstoppers, deliciously puerile gags and an infectious love of the form it so playfully skewers...Even if the show doesn\'t finish as strongly as it starts, its giddy high spirits prevail."" ', 'for a previous production""""Something Rotten!"" may not be the tidiest new musical of the Broadway season, but it\'s by far the funniest...A high-spirited, gleefully acted, past-meets-present cultural mash-up, mixing high wit with low jokes. It exists for its individual comic and musical scenes, with plot coherence discarded as excess baggage."" ', 'for a previous production""This rambunctious, song-stuffed confection details the behind-the-scenes shenanigans of a musical’s creation...“A Musical” is such a showstopper it threatens to render the rest of the show something of a comparative damp squib, and the many subsequent jokes and numbers invoking the lunacy of musicals do become a little repetitive. What carries you through is the evident fun being had by the cast."" ', 'for a previous production""With all its showmanship and silliness, \'Something Rotten!\' begins on an extremely promising note, sustains it throughout act one, and then falters in act two, where attempts are made to resolve the haywire plot.

', '""A beautiful set, expert choreography, a memorable score and brilliant acting aid the storytelling, and it all adds to the play’s fantasy theme…Lewis and Mann are excellent, as are the rest of the cast…The play ends with a ballet, depicting the future of Winnie...It wasn’t my favorite way to end the show, but I appreciate the interpretation, and I am sure any child over the age of 12 would appreciate the optimistic ending of this hopeful play."" ', '""A sweet-tempered, family friendly musical…Lewis is all the things you’d want in a young protagonist, and her Winnie has got an edge…A gorgeous silent ballet, depicting the passage of time, doesn’t integrate well with the story beforehand. This interpretation of \'Tuck Everlasting\' is neither tragic nor cynical. It’s good entertainment. If you’re bringing a child, be prepared for some hefty conversation on the way home."" ', '""\'Tuck Everlasting\' has its charming moments, including a solid opening number…At the same time, it is a show that pleases rather than thrills; the rueful, folk-inflected music and plain, often prosaic, lyrics move the story along without providing real excitement or adding to its emotional heft…There\'s no question that the final dance sequence, and its brief aftermath, brings \'Tuck Everlasting\' to a much stronger close than one expects."" ', '""Like the children’s book, the script fudges some narrative questions and complications and grapples ever-so-lightly with the complexities of infinite life. But the narrative, at least, is always buoyed by its tuneful folk-rooted score by Miller and Tysen...Director Nicholaw, here shows a more lyrical side, climaxing in a story-of-life dance number that packs an emotional wallop. At the show’s end, you’ll want to hug your family."" ', '“‘Tuck’, based on 1975 children’s book by Natalie Babbitt, was made into a poorly received 2002 Disney film. Fortunately, this period production, which started off in Atlanta, fares much better in the stage translation. The dance scenes, in particular, are beautifully wrought. While some might find the humor hokey, the big themes of love and immortality provide a framework of ideas upon which this winning production builds smartly.” ', '“Chris Miller’s composition in combination with lyrics by Nathan Tysen echoes the enchanted nature of the story, yet could have used more variety throughout the score...Overall, the musical is full of family-friendly magic, but the chief appeal is directed towards a younger audience. The beautiful dance sequence at the conclusion is certainly relatable for all ages, and is absolutely the redeeming scene of the show.” ', '""I had reservations about ‘Matilda’ but, in retrospect, its overall originality make apparent its neighbor’s relative lack of laughs, unexceptional, folk-inflected score, lack of dramatic tension, excessive sentimentality, and stretches of dullness...Several theatregoers could be spotted drying their eyes after the show ended, but only time will tell if ‘Tuck Everlasting’ has more than a famous title and a tear-jerking finale to make its stay on Broadway an everlasting one."" ', '""A wholesome but hyperactive new Broadway musical...Authors Shear and Federle make some smart changes…Composer Miller and lyricist Tysen wrap the story up in a warm and folksy score. It fits the 19th-century time period…Characters are pretty sketchy, but the cast makes the most of what they’ve got…In a stirring climactic ballet...\'Tuck Everlasting\' is allowed to breathe. Like people, musicals need that to live."" ', '""Lewis, the spunky young actress in this role, is one of the show\'s great assets, as are Carmello and Park, who beautifully evoke loving parents...\'Tuck Everlasting\' does have its charms and some likable moments—including a few pleasing numbers, some warm relationships...But there are some crucial story points that get insufficient prominence—including, bizarrely, the moment when Winnie decides whether or not to drink...Not everything will track if you don\'t know the story."" ', '""Ms. Lewis carries much of the show in a charming, precocious manner...Unfortunately, the physical production practically swallows the cast…Director/choreographer Nicholaw deftly handles the script, though it’s a sanitized version of Babbitt’s original story. He seems to have lost his way with uninspired choreography…I have a feeling that in a decade or so, we may see a very different reimagining of \'Tuck Everlasting\'—one that is older and perhaps a bit wiser."" ', '""I wanted to hate the show because at first it seemed theme-park ready, had Renaissance Fair-like choreography, and was a bit like a Holly Hobby version of a Hallmark movie. But I slowly conceded that there’s a rousing number, and the ballet finale tacking Winnie’s future is sure to get people talking...But will this thing run forever? Probably not. \'Cute\' doesn’t age well, and this show seems geared strictly for kids."" ', '""This musical has much to recommend it, but overall it is inconsistent as a work of art. It has charm and poignancy in places, but a corny, dated feel elsewhere...Most notable though is the marvelous comic timing of two secondary characters…But overall, \'Tuck Everlasting\' is not a comedy, so while the comedy songs were delightful, they made me wish for more comedy that wasn’t there...It’s a shame that the whole show isn’t as good as the second half."" ', '""The staggering finale is the only scene that completely fulfills \'Tuck Everlasting’s\' obvious aim to be one of those musicals that appeal to children of all ages. Otherwise, the candy-colorful and energetic stage adaptation seems largely suited for 11-year-old girls…The songs are all pleasant enough, albeit not especially memorable, or even essential to the show, but they are delivered by a cast of charismatic pros.""

What there is, though, is plenty of giddy, goofy fun for all.""

It’s undoubtedly clever, but it does occasionally hit some lumpy moments. These are small quibbles when it comes to more than two hours of comedy that bubble very much like uncorked vintage champagne.""

Ah…an old fashion musical done well. What makes this production such a delight is the new orchestrations by Frank Galgano and Matt Castle.""

Hoffman is delightfully daffy and droll in the role, utilizing some interesting vocal techniques in her song delivery.""

How does the experiment work? Splendidly...For tuneful family holiday fun, with an energetic cast kicking up its heels in the service of bringing extra oomph to tried-and-true material, this \'Mattress\' is hard to beat.""

But even grade-D titles deserve grade-A treatments, so give them credit for that.""

That is, except when Ms. Hoffman is blushing and belting or Mr. Epperson is doing Lypsinka doing Aggravain...More surprisingly, Ms. Hoffman’s Winnifred is genuinely affecting...That turns out to be quite enough to win the hearts of a prince, and an audience."" ', '""The elastic-faced Hoffman has finally gotten a leading role she’s long deserved…Her rendition of \'I’m Shy\' is a highlight of the season…A cast of first-rate comic pros executes the daffy plot…Given all the goodies, it is easier to forgive the ways the musical is dated…A running time of 150 minutes has become too long for what is essentially sketch comedy. And, as good as their performances are, the humor is far less funny than it once must have been."" ', '""It\'s a thin, silly story to fuel a two-and-a-half hour musical, and the antic book features more than a few groan-worthy gags. The score, too, is unmemorable...But assuming you\'re in the right mood, the show is fun nonetheless, and this production, exuberantly directed by Jack Cummings III, is ultimately hard to resist. Hoffman is a deliciously daffy Winnifred. She uses her expert comic timing and nasal vocal delivery to make her character\'s desperation hilariously palpable."" ', '""The freewheeling new \'Once Upon a Mattress\' comes with a concept: Belt loudly and carry a big shtick. The plan works for this musical riff on \'The Princess and the Pea\' that made a Broadway star out of Carol Burnett in 1959...At nearly 2 1/2 hours, it takes too long to get to the happily ever after. But when it comes, Hoffman is there for another zinger."" ', '""Fairy tales that end with the proverbial \'everyone lived happily ever after\' are strictly lightweight, one-note fare. The revival of \'Once Upon a Mattress\' off-Broadway at the Abrons Arts Center, is no exception...It\'s a staid Fifties-style work, though Mary Rodgers\' score is melodious and Marshall Barer\'s lyrics enjoyable. The Transport Group\'s rendition is fairly lively, given its parameters, and Hoffman is a standout. Known as a belter, she can also carry more tender melodies.""

The show still sparkles with glitz. Beware, however: Nostalgia can be deceiving...Unfortunately, the book has not aged as gracefully. Many scenes feel like amusing diversions rather than crucial plot points.""

Wils Wilson’s exuberant production is staged in the bar as a lock-in, with a cracking cast...The piece loses some pace and grip in the Devil’s lair and the drunken karaoke scene goes on too long. But there’s great fun in the way this ingenious exploration of Scottish culture crosses borders with glee.""

The actors circulate among us, climbing onto our tables...The production is buoyed by the resourcefulness of director Wils Wilson, who makes economical use of limited space and design elements.""

The principal creative force behind this revival is Randy Skinner. He has beautifully and imaginatively recreated that delicate balance of parody and reverence that made these \'dames\' such a delight originally. But he has added just enough more exuberant dancing and production values to make it now the most irresistible musical in town."" ', '""It’s terrific with a capital T...This a good old-fashioned Broadway treat. Tits, teeth, tapping, tunes, and tight trousers – terrific."" ', '""For lovers of the genre, \'Dames at Sea\' is a delightful romp that doesn\'t feel like it\'s aged a day since 1966...Director and choreographer Randy Skinner brings the material to life as if it exploded out of an old movie...Those who regularly get goosebumps when they hear a tap shoe hit a Masonite floor will be on cloud nine for hours after the curtain comes down."" ', '""A technicolor, tap dance-filled tribute to the movie musicals of the 1930s. It’s delightful, and it doesn’t take itself seriously for a minute...\'Dames at Sea\' is a small-scale musical, crammed into Broadway’s teensiest theater, but with the gumption of a mighty battleship."" ', '""Why bring this trifle to Broadway, for the first time, 49 years after its downtown premiere? Never mind; just check your cares and pretensions at the door of the Helen Hayes Theatre, and prepare to be thoroughly charmed...Through it all, happily, Skinner keeps everyone dancing, providing exuberant tap routines that his cast executes with joyful facility."" ', '""Goofy, giddy, silly, old-fashioned fun – this show’s got tons of it. If you find it funny the the male romantic lead is named Dick, then you’ll have a good time. If you get why it’s funny that the female lead is named Ruby, then you are \'Dames at Sea‘s\' target audience."" ', '""\'Dames at Sea\' is a very funny and witty diversion of a show and should be seen by anyone who just wants to spend a few hours in a theater, relax and try and remember what Broadway used to be all about. I’m still tapping my feet and that’s not easy."" ', '""Randy Skinner\'s tap-happy production delivers plenty of sly amusement thanks to a ferociously talented sextet of triple threats. If this tiny show occasionally sits a little awkwardly even on a small Broadway stage, it\'s a small price to pay for the abundant fun on display…It\'s musical comedy madness accompanied by a cascade of insanely catchy songs…The inclusion of an extended dance break for nearly every number results in a certain predictability that slows down the first act a bit."" ', '""\'Dames at Sea\' is not your typical tap musical. While it does pay homage to the days of Cole Porter and Fred Astaire, the show acts almost like a lighthearted parody of the musicals of that time. Full of self-aware humor and comical jabs at how sensationalized the plot is, this production acts as a refreshing, laugh-out-loud contemporary companion to the shows from the era it’s set in."" ', '""\'Dames at Sea\' is throwback theatre...It’s got nothing on its mind other than enjoying itself at the expense of a harmless cultural shibboleth. It breaks no new ground, its score is enjoyable but not for the ages, its perpetual tap dancing can seem a bit much, and it may sometimes be too cute for its own good. But, to quote a better-known musical, if you let it entertain you, you’ll have a real good time."" ', '""\'Dames at Sea\' may be incredibly limited in its scope and aims, but it does what it does smartly enough that, when it\'s adeptly helmed by a director and choreographer like this production\'s Randy Skinner, you don\'t really care. No, it never registers as much more than what it is...But it jumps into its daffiness with both feet, and splashes you with fun. For a mere two hours, even I can\'t find a way to argue with its charms."" ', '""Those who love lots of tap dancing, old-fashioned tunes, and a touch of camp get down to the Helen Hayes Theatre on the double…These three young performers are all fine singers and remarkable dancers – you’ll gasp as they execute director Randy Skinner’s breathtaking (and breathless) choreographers – but they do lack a bit of star power…Lesli Margherita continues to steal scene after scene with her deliberately scenery-chewing and often hilarious antics."" ', '""Skinner directs \'Dames at Sea\' as well, but it is his choreography which keeps the show on its toes from beginning to end. He has stacked the deck with an ingratiating cast, including two standout performances. So there is plenty for musical comedy audiences to be happy about, especially at a time when there is nothing else on Broadway in this category.""

But while the hard-working cast keeps the bubble afloat, \'Dames\' is a delight.""

"" ', '""Some grumpy reviews speculate that younger audiences may not know the source material well enough to fully appreciate what’s being satirized, deriding the material for being just empty-calorie escapism. Well, it is, but it’s as solidly built as escapism gets, and one of the rare musicals currently on display that actually sends you out happy and humming."" ', '""Director and choreographer Randy Skinner doesn\'t take the show too seriously, which is a good thing. It\'s a cotton candy plot we\'ve heard before…But the cast of six is tremendous, and the focus stays squarely on the thundering tap dancing, where it belongs. Plus, there are some clever moments…The show isn\'t a dazzler, but it\'s a fun, family-friendly musical that will be a holiday season crowd-pleaser. You might just find yourself tap dancing home."" ', '""When choosing a Broadway show to attend, sometimes, it’s good to just pick something that is light, airy and doesn’t require any heavy lifting on the part of the audience. In other words, a romantic comedy musical. With that in mind, I recommend you set sail for \'Dames at Sea\'...The plot is kind of thin, but no matter, the star of this show is the incredible tap dancing numbers showcasing awesome talent."" ', '""‘Dames At Sea’ is a lot of fun and a tribute to the city’s inexhaustible pool of inexhaustible talent, if not actual stars…Broadway today is awash in nostalgia in the form of revivals, reboots and parodies, all done on a far larger scale and offering considerably more bang, or tap, for the buck. And good as they are, the dancers never let us forget just how hard they’re working to please us."" ', '""Nearly half a century after its Off-Off Broadway debut, the Broadway version isn’t staged with exceptional ingenuity; it doesn’t have to be. The production values are ratcheted up, but not as much as the ticket prices...The biggest change on Broadway is that the show somehow no longer feels like an ironic if loving send-up of a 30’s extravaganza, but something closer to an imitation of one."" ', '""A very streamlined theatrical experience... Presenting the story as a series of rapid, jokey moments does have its downside...In \'Dames at Sea\' there\'s so little separation between musical routines, they acquire a rote-like quality, especially with the overload of tap-dancing, which is resolutely inserted wherever possible. ‘Dames at Sea’ is a period piece that, in its limited way, still has some life and laughs."" ', '""\'Dames\' is a perfectly happy theatrical entry, but perhaps it has spent fifty years off Broadway for a reason: its satire does not bite so much as nibble. This production could have benefitted from a larger cast, a larger theater, or a larger reason to exist — something that turns it from nice to necessary. As this very solid production stands, it’s not particularly nautical and not particularly naughty, either."" ', '""The new leading lady of \'Dames at Sea\' is no Bernadette Peters. There’s nothing wrong with this revival that Peters, who played the role of Ruby in the original, couldn’t fix. But musical theater stars of her caliber don’t grow on trees, and although newcomer Eloise Kropp is a power tapper par excellence, she hasn’t the saucy charm of a Broadway Baby like Ruby — or the magnetic appeal of a star like Peters.""

Add to this, Melissa Erica, Stephen Boards, John Curia in small snappy cast of singers and dancers, and there is good reason to head to the Irish Repertory Theatre...By stressing the superb Lerner and Lane songbook rather than the screwy Lerner libretto, Moore offers a musical major-league summer refreshment in an efficiently scaled down production.""

Bogardus brings dignity to the role of her romantic shrink, if not much sex appeal. Unfortunately, the supporting cast poses, reacts, and overacts all over the place. The result is a perfunctory yet entertaining version that is, at least, a vast improvement over the unspeakable, short-lived 2011 Broadway revival.” ', '“A production that attempts to find simplicity and clarity in an otherwise wacky and even preposterous script. It succeeds at some turns through sheer talent and conviction but gets cloudy at others...Lyrics are forgettable at best and downright silly at their worst.

Fiddler On The Roof,"['""Extraordinary Director Bartlett Sher in this unfinished masterpiece of a restoration to the New York stage yet again has put his stamp on one of the miracles of American musical theatre with clarity, love and courage.

Simple. Marvelous. But none has achieved the intensity of the highs in Bartlett Sher’s... ', '""Positively transcendent — a luminous new view on a timeless tale…No element of the production better represents the happy synthesis of old and new than Hofesh Shechter\'s vibrant choreography…Shechter and Sher offer this story of a traditional society at the precipice as something universal, without negating the play\'s indelible Jewish identity...Sher endows this beautiful and timely production with a sense of optimism and continuity."" ', '""Bartlett Sher’s magnificent, life-affirming revival…Rich ambivalence runs through much of Sher’s elegant and deeply satisfying staging…This revival is splendidly acted…Revelatory direction, eloquent visuals and that sublime klezmer-inflected score —what more do you need? A great Tevye, and Burstein is nothing short of a miracle, finding the modern mensch in Tevye, as well as the hard-nosed, belief-bound peasant."" ', '""Sher\'s staging mines every dramatic nuance and every ounce of character-based humor in Joseph Stein\'s indestructible book…The dancing is simply extraordinary…The revival owes much of its emotional heft to impeccable casting..The duality of humor and horror is essential to \'Fiddler,\' and as in every other aspect, this superb production captures that balance with enormous soulfulness...The show also closes the Broadway year on a magnificent note."" ', '""Danny Burstein\'s performance anchors a production that, like Sher\'s previous stagings of American classics reveals both the timelessness and the contemporary pertinence of the work. His \'Fiddler\' is arguably even more revelatory…Sher does this with the support of a seamless cast and an intuitive, inventive design team...What this \'Fiddler\' shows us most powerfully is the resilience of love. For all its specific insights, it delivers that simple and universal message, thrillingly."" ', '""Now we have another game-changer in town...It applies to director Bartlett Sher’s exciting new vision for \'Fiddler on the Roof\'...\'Times are changing\' and Sher has caused a change in \'Fiddler\', too, making an already potent story far more involving...You’ll have to experience this \'Fiddler\' yourself. Do discover the substantial number of thoughtful touches that Bartlett Sher has brought to a classic which in the process has created a classic of his own."" ', '""The power of this classic moved me to tears. Danny Burstein’s performance as Tevye is instantly lovable, and alternates between hilarious and heartbreaking. The music is so strong; practically all of the numbers are classics. Despite clocking in at nearly three hours, the show feels trim and sparse — each song, each moment, feels necessary...Sher conjures up images of Syrian refugees and makes a connection between their plight and Tevye’s. It’s brilliant, artistic, and relevant."" ', '""The dancing is simply sensational, the orchestrations the best ever and the cast certainly gives it a super effort to keep us memorized. If you have never seen it (and unless you’re under 6 you probably haven’t) it’s a must see for anyone looking for Broadway\'s best.""

But it has to be done right. Some details can be argued, but overall, Bartlett Sher has done it right.""

Yes, but what a musical. The score enters your bloodstream, indelibly, upon a single hearing...And Joseph Stein’s book miraculously blends borscht belt humor with a moving depiction of Tevye’s conflicted heart."" ', '""If the show has one flaw it is that the one hour and 40 minute first act seems long, but the shorter, fast-moving second act with its many events surely makes up for it. The ending is extremely moving and will have many theatergoers on the brink of tears...Bartlett Sher’s revival has the depth of a straight play and may be the best sung \'Fiddler\' in recent memory. Danny Burstein, Jessica Hecht and cast make one fall in love with this musical all over again."" ', '""As he did with \'The King and I\', \'South Pacific\' and \'Golden Boy\' Bartlett Sher has brought his own vision to this production and yet remained true to the show\'s view of tradition as ongoing, changing and ever meaningful to people of all faiths…Despite more than a quarter century of Teyves, the role now seems written for Danny Burstein...He connects so fully and naturally with the audience that his comic reflections on life seem as much with them as with God."" ', '""With its wonderful music and lyrics the show is virtually indestructible…Bartlett Sher, who has so adeptly directed revivals of classic musicals at Lincoln Center, does not disappoint...Ultimately, the show’s success rests on its Tevye. Danny Burstein is superb, offering more humanity and less shtick than some of his predecessors…The show’s emotional highlights worked their usual magic on me. It’s good to have this stellar example of the golden age of American musicals back in town."" ', '""Director Bart Sher and lead actor Danny Burstein deliver as movingly dramatic a \'Fiddler\' as we’re ever likely to see…The performances are mixed. Jessica Hecht as Golde seems at first miscast and her accent out of place but her talent ultimately prevails…Sher’s emphasis on the dramatic core of the story is well served by Burstein whose warmly understated command of the iconic Tevye — mastering the comedy and tragedy — wins our hearts completely."" ', '""The revival of \'Fiddler on the Roof\' is wonderful — not because it offers a wildly different take on the popular musical, but by revealing the heart and soul of the story in such a fresh way...The production runs almost three hours, but it moves so smoothly, it seems much shorter.""

', '""With its brilliant book and its rousing and thrillingly integrated score, \'Fiddler\' is the kind of work where familiarity breeds only more affection. Sher’s company validates that affection by imbuing the milieu with a crackling sense of life...Throughout the show, the large orchestra contributes immeasurably to the show’s vivacity and emotional strength…A show that for the most part excels in bringing a classic work to grand life, with tradition beautifully deep in its soul."" ', '""Staged with humor and humanity, this \'Fiddler on the Roof\' redefines tradition…Burstein’s patriarch is infectiously charming, occasionally boyish, but with the gravitas needed…Burstein has plenty to work with, including a terrific sparring partner in Hecht and an ensemble of triple-threat character actors…The creative team assembled to help realize Sher’s vision is mostly successful.""

This brings a renewed adoration and appreciation of a work that has indeed become a tradition...Be prepared to be thrilled once again by a grand and emotionally moving \'Fiddler on the Roof.\'"" ', '“Broadway musicals are so often disappointing because they don’t really believe in the value of their silliness. In other words, they hedge their bets...The joys of this show (and this particular revival) come in its ability to make the audience submit to childish but essential feelings, the kinds that inspire us to belt show tunes off-key and dance like idiots. Indeed, I soon found myself vigorously waggling my arms like Tevye immediately after the show. It felt exquisite.” ', '""Vibrant and brilliant and heartfelt...The only odd note in this show is Golde, who is too shrill and one dimensional, and struggles with the vocal requirements. She never reveals her crusted-over warmth and her duet with Tevye is consequently underwhelming. But brilliant touches are everywhere elsewhere...It all adds up to a remarkable achievement. From the first moment to the profound last, this \'Fiddler on the Roof\' is a triumph. The show is the star.""

', '""It would be difficult to beat Rodgers and Hammerstein for fraught musical romance...The moving \'Carousel\' offers fantasy that illuminates hardscrabble life rather than creating an escape route...Henry is simply marvelous...He’s so immersed in Billy that every, even silent gesture feels in keeping...O’Brien brings nonmusical theater skills to this affecting drama. Nuance proliferates. The director’s painterly eye creates peopled visuals that are never less than aesthetically pleasing."" ', '""Big, bold, and beautiful—feeling every bit as soaringly operatic and heart-wrenchingly intimate as it must have upon its debut in 1945. That’s thanks to a quintet of smashing principal performances, stunning choreography, an enchanting set design, and a generous, 24 piece orchestra...From the very first downbeat, Mr. Peck asserts his creative command, clearly articulating every key relationship in the story and setting the tone and sensibility of the show."" ', '""As lovely as anything you’ll see and hear this season. If only Billy Bigelow could keep his fists off women...\'Carousel\' is, without question, among the most radiantly beautiful musicals ever created, its songs a series of flawless gems...It’d be hard to imagine a better sung \'Carousel\' than this one...Director O’Brien draws out the shifting moods – \'Carousel\' isn’t all melancholy by any means – and is matched by Justin Peck’s balletic choreography, by turns fluid and rigorous."" ', '""A sublime hit...Henry as carnival barker Billy Bigelow, glistening on stage, delivering a vocal and dramatic performance...This is his breakthrough, and it’s just jaw dropping good. You want to him hear him sing anything, all day long...You’re almost taken aback hearing gorgeous, trained voices handing sublimely written music. For that – for the mesmerizing unfolding carousel canopy at the beginning of Act 1 – this show is a memorable winner."" ', '""One of the more problematic works of Rodgers and Hammerstein, but it also contains some of their best music...In the delightful revival, that music is given the star treatment...A stellar cast...The topic of spousal abuse could not be more relevant, and it is front and center in \'Carousel\'...Mueller is lovely as Julie...Henry shows Billy to be tender, angry, funny, sad and determined...\'Carousel\' offers a highlight reel of the best of the Golden Age of Broadway."" ', '""Taking on the character Nettie, Fleming scores an unquestionable success...Fleming may be closing in on 60, but here she sounded as fresh and as emotionally riveting as ever...Among the other actors, the night belonged to Henry, whose Billy immersed the audience in a tragic hero\'s journey...He also sang like a god...The production by O\'Brien moved with great agility and grace throughout the night, transitioning from one scene to the next seamlessly."" ', '""A first-rate revival...As dark and as romantically moody as the classic piece demands...Has some troubling issues to deal with locked down inside the text...Beautifully introduces all the characters and situation expertly....O\'Brien had to find a way to deal with the lead male character and his unsympathetic actions...It\'s his uncontrollable curse, this inability to cope and manage his emotions, and in some ways, it is also the curse of this complicated and dark musical."" ', '""Judged solely on the quality of its expertly-crafted book, its captivating music and the emotional poetics of its lyrics, \'Carousel\' must be regarded as one of the art form\'s highest achievements...While those, like this critic, who prefer to see theatre pieces performed with the text the authors wrote, will wince at the many changes...what remains still provides enchantment, thrills, great drama and solid laughs in a well-performed and vibrantly choreographed production.""

It's a witty how-to for establishing lasting relationships.” "", '""The writers often veer into clichés, but explore them with freshness and candor, even dealing with Henry\'s embarrassing reaction when he embraces Christine after their first date (\'Hard\').

Still, watching a handful of romantic comedies for guidance would have saved a lot of anguish...Elish collaborated on the lyrics with Cohen, who composed the bland tunes that never test the cast, but he bears sole responsibility for the book.""

Bill Irwin did crack me up as the magician’s big haired lovely assistant/jealous girlfriend in a skit that I must say stretched on a bit too long past the punchline.

It doesn\'t advance the story, but that doesn\'t matter because it\'s such a hoot entirely on its own. Like the whole evening, it\'s just fun.""

Plaid Tidings,"['""The humorous banter among the four and their slide-splitting re-creation of the Ed Sullivan show are reason enough to see \'Plaid Tidings.\' Add in their four-part close harmony renditions of more than thirty songs and you’ve got a perfect holiday frolic…Although it helps to be familiar with the style the Plaids are lampooning, the show can be appreciated as a gentle, happy, comic musical caper with nothing on its mind but pleasing the audience."" ', '""The one improvement that could be made to the show is the pacing of the first act. It takes what seems like most of Act I for the guys to realize what their mission is, and while the cascade of old-time tunes is entertaining, the show really finds its momentum once it settles into it’s holiday groove. All in all, \'Plaid Tidings\' is a solid win for good, clean and wholesome holiday fun."" ', '""The slightly overstuffed two-hour show is packed with tasty bonbons in the form of expertly performed songs and clever musical staging...The comic shtick is hit or miss, though, and the corn is as high as an elephant\'s eye...With the same music playing in every store and elevator these days, the music holds few surprises; nonetheless, it’s well enough done that it really doesn’t matter."" ', '""For anyone who likes to laugh – a lot – and who’s seeking a respite from the stresses and strains of the daily grind, \'Plaid Tidings\' is for you...The show, two acts with intermission, probably would benefit from running straight through without interruption – the pace is fast and there’s a steady buildup to the payoff: a priceless homage to an era gone by."" ', '""I hadn’t seen the \'Forever Plaid\' guys in decades, and I’d completely forgotten they were dead. But all was made clear by the narrator of \'Plaid Tidings,\' the group’s sweetly enjoyable holiday show...The finest moment belongs to Perry Como, who appears on a black-and-white console TV as the Plaids sing backup...It all seems completely organic, to the credit of Stuart Ross, who wrote, directed and did the musical staging."" ', '""Against all expectations, it\'s a sweet, silly enjoyable evening of popular songs, enlivened by some good jokes (and some bad jokes) and blessed with a cast that elevates the modest material nicely. \'Plaid Tidings\' proves to be glad tidings for anyone wanting comfort food in their theater outing this holiday season.""

', 'for a previous production""The Christmas show plot’s a little goofy and the result a bit disjointed...The note-dropping shtick quickly becomes tedious, but all is forgiven when they start to sing in that fab ’50s close-harmony style...The Plaids have been packing them in for nearly two decades now and have inspired legions of Plaid Heads, fans who see each show multiple times, sometimes even following them from one gig to another."" ', 'for a previous production""The foursome are granted permission to return to earth for one final show. \'Plaid Tidings\' allows them an encore performance. Once you get past that rather morbid setup, \'Plaid Tidings\' proves a nostalgic, funny, tuneful two hours of Christmas cheer...Ross’s script can get a little corny (or a lot), as when one of the boys reveals his tip for staying young in the afterlife, but as long as Forever Plaid are singing, it’s first-rate holiday entertainment."" ', 'for a previous production“\'Plaid Tidings\' isn’t so much a sequel as a rehash...The comedy content is mostly enjoyable but bland; it can get wearying if you’re familiar with Ross’ franchise...Two hours with Ross’ lovable losers is more than enough, perhaps inspiring cynicism as much as instilling holiday cheer. That’s the flip side of creating a show that banks on audiences’ need for and response to nostalgia for the innocence of a bygone time."" ', 'for a previous production""The Globe\'s \'Plaid Tidings\' cast is very good, and most have done \'Plaid\' shows so many times they could do the moves and music in their sleep, but that\'s one of my quibbles with the show...Ross has written a joke into the \'Plaid Tidings\' script that implies that people continue aging after death, but the boyish goofiness  still seems a bit off for the maturity of the quartet onstage...The foursome are all excellent singers and good actors.""

Never fear, however, as these four Plaids sing with the greatest of ease and blend.""

It is the story of Tom Jones - a bastard raised in the home of a country squire. Written as a response to the hypocritical puritans of King George the III's time, it can be considered quite bawdy or extremely raunchy, depending on your puritanical moral compass. Staged in a tiny theater, with minimal props, it is an unexpected surprise (if a bit long).” "", '""\'Bastard Jones\' is surprisingly accessible for a contemporary musical based on a long and episodic 18th century novel. Sophisticated and off-color, naughty but nice, it proves to be a sharp and irreverent entertainment. With a terrific cast and a star making performance by Evan Ruggiero, witty and clever, \'Bastard Jones\' is both a delightful 18th century and 21st century evening in the theater."" ', '""An incredibly clever, zany, sexy, and raucous show that is as funny as it is profound...This is just the sort of guilty fun that everyone is looking for and, for a little over two hours, will bring such joy to your heart and a \'tingle\' to everywhere else...With a score that is heart-pumping, contemplative and altogether wonderful, and a plot that is given a dose of modernity to make it comical, \'Bastard Jones\' will become one of your favorite shows you hope to see on a Broadway stage one day."" ', '""There are numerous reasons to see \'Bastard Jones,\' but topping the list is to purely enjoy an evening of raucous fun...Acito has deftly directed his motley cast with a distinct madcap style, never losing sight of the underlying affirmative message of human rights...The entire cast each stands on their own and embraces the word ensemble...Do not miss this limited engagement, which certainly deserves a continued life in the vibrant New York theater scene."" ', '""This rock musical comedy started out with a bang and ended with an earth shaking finale. The play told the oft-comedic tale of Tom Jones, a 1749 story of a bastard ward to an English squire named Allworthy. Marc Acito, the writer of Allegiance, did a superb job of weaving amusing action between entertaining songs setting the stage for gripping reveals. He and lyricist Amy Engelhardt were aided by an energetic cast with strong vocal talent that provided us ample opportunity to bask in awe."" ', '“Acito does a great job of bringing every cast member’s uniqueness forward. Wang delivers a flawless vocal performance as the childhood friend that has captured Tom’s heart…Engelhardt’s music is tastefully varied, making bold choices even in comedic numbers. The lyrics seem to inject adrenaline into the satire of yesteryear, adding a little modern obscenity to keep things fresh...This adaptation highlights the joy of sexuality, and leads by example with a talented, diverse cast."" ', ""“Musical comedy is actually far too tame a way to describe what goes way beyond even musical farce in its rowdy, hellzapoppin approach, throwing realism to the winds and—although there's no nudity per se—letting it all hang out…A carefully calibrated cacophony of door slamming, head banging, and otherwise free-swinging mayhem, supplemented by…vibrantly energetic choreography…The show's biggest drawback is its sophomoric humor.” "", '""\'Bastard Jones\' is randy yet ingenuous; it’s like a very bawdy Disney movie, with hummable pop music to match. Staged with few frills, it relies mainly on the talents of its diverse and impressive cast of nine...If this smartly plotted and irrepressible musical moves beyond the Cell, there is work to be done in beefing up the characters and polishing the jokes. But the show has legitimate potential."" ', '""The Cell feels like an R-rated living room...The townhouse can seat a few dozen, and the action jumps between floors, plenty of phallic references, and innovative staging by Acito...In the title role, Ruggiero is a charmer, with a wide-eyed disposition and piercing voice...\'Bastard Jones\' could use some trimming in its running time, and some minor tightening of its bits, but these are minor considerations."" ', '""\'Bastard Jones\' is a heck of a good time...Not all of the show\'s songs are equal. Don\'t get me wrong, the singers are fantastic, but not every number can be a winner. Luckily this talented group knows how to act through their singing, which was a nice surprise...If you are an adult and like entertaining songs, talented actors, a decent love story, funny jokes, and some plot twists, this is a wonderful way to spend an evening."" ', '""Mr. Acito mostly succeeds in turning the Cell company’s limited resources into an aesthetic choice...Harder to overcome are the venue’s trying acoustics, which make it difficult to fully appreciate the score by Engelhardt...But you can still tell that catchy songs, reminiscent of Lloyd Webber’s pop-rock catalog, are lurking in there...\'Bastard Jones\' goes through clunky patches, but its nonjudgmental approach to sex and disability, and its brash desire to entertain, are winning."" ', ""“The shaggy and generally endearing new rock musical comedy captures the raucous spirit of the original novel while gently targeting 21st century issues…Ruggiero carries the musical with ease, and he is charming, sexy, and innocently goofy in equal measure…Acito has done an outstanding job synthesizing the expansive plot and episodes of the original source material…Acito's lyrics are rather less distinctive...Similarly, Engelhardt's music is often pleasant but not memorable.” "", '""All the same, there is much fun to be had. Most of the comedy, for me at least, came in the form of the puns, quips, and one-liners delivered primarily by Partridge, but also many of the other characters. (As an example, one particularly groan-worthy joke, uttered in a ball scene, I must echo here: ‘What are you doing here?’ ‘The minuet!’) There was also a good deal of slapstick, but never to the point that it felt overdone."" ', '""A vibrant 21st-century creation, utilizing rock, ballads, and the occasional reverb...Ruggiero displays indomitable athleticism...The cast works tirelessly to keep the story going, and the inn at Upton approximates the door-slamming farce in the film...Overall, though, high comedy has lost to low on several fronts...What \'Bastard Jones\' needs is the class-conscious, tongue-in-cheekiness of \'A Gentlemen’s Guide to Love and Murder.\' Too often what was playfully bawdy is now merely vulgar."" ', '""Dispiritingly, the dialogue is loaded with the kind of gags not heard since Minsky\'s Burlesque was shuttered forever...Suffice to say that a full evening of these smirkers is enough to induce vows of chastity in audience members looking for some semblance of adult wit. The songs don\'t provide much relief, a few appealing melodies aside...Given the general poverty of the humor, it\'s striking how well the cast, under Acito\'s direction, maintains its sense of high spirits.""

New York Spectacular,"['“An exhilarating ode, paean, and ballad to the spirit of this dynamic city in full throttle.

You can only stand on the sidelines and scream your adulation and feverish adoration...Put this at the very top of your summer to do list!” ', '""The new eye-popping summer show will not only lift your spirits, but also put you in the most glorious New York state of mind…Michaels has put fire in the bellies of the Rockettes. Their energy, first seen in the opening number set to Taylor Swift’s \'Welcome to New York,\' is palpable. And it only gets better…Each production number breathes fresh air into a commodity that dates back to 1925...Beane’s script is chock-full of ripe one-liners, but many get lost in the echoey hall."" ', '""Both in their billing and physically onstage, the Rockettes become the main attraction — exactly what one might expect from a Radio City experience...The top-notch cast support the production with a story that entertains, teaches, and tugs at the heartstrings, all in equal parts…The choreography was sharp and precise, and one could definitely feel Michaels’ influence in each dance...The beauty of the story is that it never loses its heart, ultimately reminding us to never lose our inner child."" ', '""I was pleasantly surprised to find myself watching the stage with wide-eyed wonder...The real and the conjured overlapped to astonishing effect. All the digital wizardry, stage craft elements, and human talents were seamlessly organized...Michaels has combined the tradition of the Rockettes chorus line with original, imaginative movement, adding some modern vibrancy and class to the time-honored act...While not requiring great intellect to appreciate the show, it’s a lot of fun."" ', '""Radio City Music Hall has been trying hard to give its precision-dance troupe, the Rockettes, something to do beyond Christmas — with little luck...But the third time’s the charm. This year’s edition, choreographed and directed by Mia Michaels, uses most of the same building blocks but improves on them — even if the new book, about a tourist family that gets separated in New York City, is still too gushy and rah-rah.""

From a technical standpoint it\'s always impressive, with arresting visuals making up for tepid (often garbled) dialogue and performances dwarfed by the cavernous venue. But the show\'s best special effects are the stylish precision dancers...They\'re guaranteed to convert even the most jaded natives."" ', '""If you love New York, there are a handful of lump-in-your-throat moments...Sure, they are rather baldly emotionally manipulative, but I for one didn’t care…Director/choreographer Mia Michaels has pulled together a daunting number of elements to put together an extravaganza that can hold its head up high next to the Rockettes’ legendary holiday-season shows. Recommended."" ', '""A 90-minute brazen, unapologetic and big-budgeted love letter to its own city...The audience comes alive each and every time those famous Rockettes grace the stage.

Now might be the time."" ', '""\'New York Spectacular,\' a new summer show that features the Radio City Rockettes and some terrific sets, aims to tap into a similar demographic as Broadway.

In a thin plot, the two children of a family visiting the city get separated from their parents while in the subway...It’s hokey, sure, but the sets and the video and projection design are so visually splendid."" ', '""A sleek, pretty summer musical…Beane\'s often-too-sweet script is also peppered with jokes only adults will get…Michaels\'s editing is as sharp as her twitchy, leg-lifting touches. She knows the stars of the show are the Rockettes — and they shine…The show meanders into some weird places...But there\'s plenty of magic here...\'The New York Spectacular\' might not be perfect, but it\'s made huge steps in both editing and technology."" ', '""The dominant kid-friendly storyline at times gets tiresome...The pacing suffers and you’re left eagerly awaiting the next big Rockette production number…The new material doesn’t always mix well with the precision type dancing we are used to seeing. However, if you’re game for an updated look and feel, there are still plenty of great performances and much spectacle to be enjoyed in the \'New York Spectacular.\'"" ', '""The Rockettes are the stars of this sensory-overload summer show...But the whole enterprise is misshapen, its disconnected episodes strung together by a story that has no real reason for being and whose human scale feels utterly dwarfed on the gigantic Radio City stage...It’s a glittery pageant, where music, dance and design need to be paramount. Put those at the center, replace cynicism with celebration, and you might have entertainment worth watching."" ', '“An unflattering dark streak runs through this 85-minute evening, ensuring that, although it may be many things, unbridled fun is never really one of them...Beyond curb-stomping credulity, it sets up the show as one based on loss and fear, rather than joy, which is an odd, frequently unsettling approach....Mia Michaels\'s production feels as if it\'s making excuses."" ', ""“The production isn't quite sure what it wants to be. The songs, orchestrated with a hip-hop beat by Christopher Jahnke, are completely unrecognizable. The script rarely has the pithy verve that is Beane's stock-in-trade as a playwright...Under Michaels' slack direction, the dialogue scenes get lost in a stage filled with massive set pieces and projections...Most disappointing is the choreography, which feels rudimentary and devoid of the flair that won Michaels an Emmy.” "", 'you love SHOWS with dazzling costumes, great choreography and talented dancers.', 'you want to see something new and different.

Othello: The Remix,"[""“Written, composed and directed by GQ and JQ, ‘Othello: The Remix’ is a funny, quick-paced modern retelling of the tragedy set in the world of rap stars, recording studios and the party scene. The rhymes come swiftly, showing off the intelligence of the two writers. They are able to both make fun of ‘Othello’ and the business they're in while still loving both to death. They take witty pot shots at other pop stars and the machinations of Shakespeare's convoluted plotline are all quite clever.” "", '""The rhythm hits hard and is brilliant in its presentation…They’re par excellence as rappers, movers and shakers as the pacing moves quickly via the brilliance of GQ and JQ, who composed and direct this hot little production…During this uniquely clever and modern adaptation, they find time to engage the audience in their antics...This is a Shakespeare lesson for all ages. The energy level is high and higher and you’ll laugh your way through this brand-new interpretation of the Bard."" ', '""It takes on a powerful story and translates it brilliantly to hip hop terms...And it does it with a cast of just four astounding rapper/actors. A galvanising non-stop current of rhythmic beats and incisive rhyming jargon, the show is at times funny and ultimately gripping...Perhaps the ultimate strength of the show is how closely the four performers work together throughout its 80 minutes. It’s like watching a top-notch team score repeatedly on an athletic field."" ', '""I was incredibly impressed by \'Othello: The Remix\'...When I say impressed I do not only mean that I was inspired by this production, but I also felt taught by it...It is not every day that a take on this English masterpiece is fresh and enlightening upon the material. \'Othello: The Remix\' shows not only the humor of this world-renown play, but also the darkness...I would highly recommend \'Othello: The Remix,\' and hope everyone that can goes to see one of the best shows currently Off-Broadway."" ', '""The tragedy of \'Othello\' is told by a quintet of rap artists creating eight roles by using irresistible beats, fast-paced prose, and wildly inventive language blending rhyming couplets into humor-driven, tragic, touching and gripping theater for today’s younger generation. This is Shakespeare for the streets…The cast is jammin\' and off the chain, the directors and writers GQ and JQ know their crib and inhabit it body, mind and soul."" ', '""The Q Brothers have effectively and entertainingly transposed \'Othello\'s\' story into modern rhyme…They\'ve remained true to the narrative even though it all plays out in a fast-paced 80 minutes…The remix also means that plenty of comedy has been mixed into the storytelling...Gets most of its laughs from the split-second timing with which the cast switches roles...The title role is portrayed with verve and genuine emotional depth by Postell Pringle."" ', '""Desdemona appears only as a pillow on a bed, and the other roles are taken by these four actors. The rapping incorporates enough of Shakespeare’s language to give the show a surprising heft and consistency, and the compression is at once hilarious and respectful. Most important, GQ’s Iago is more recognizable as an amoral force hellbent on destruction...The show is co-produced by John Leguizamo, and it’s rich."" ', '""The show is written, composed and directed by the immensely talented brothers GQ & JQ playing several roles along with two other excellent actors...The lyrics are fanciful and quite clever...The ingenious lyrics are sung with such clarity that you appreciate every reference. The writers have made necessary changes that work perfectly...A wryly comedic romp with ferociously dedicated performances makes this \'Othello\' overwhelmingly enjoyable."" ', '""The show is created by the Q Brothers, meaning music, words and direction…Their ability to coalesce a tale and excite an audience is impressive. Everyone in this cast is not only supremely talented, but they seem as if they are having a blast and we lucky few get to watch and clap and groan at puns and just get happily awestruck. There is a wonderful harkening back to the original Shakespeare modality even though the words are magically modern."" ', '""A fun and lively hip-hop retelling of Shakespeare\'s tragedy of racism and revenge...While \'Othello: The Remix\' is certainly all in good fun, the two instances when the guys play female characters come off more as easy gags compared with the more fleshed out males. But the 80-minute romp is a high-energy kick, making a strong case for the elevated language rap to be a modern equivalent of Shakespeare\'s poetic verse."" ', '""You might think that the technique applied to those Shakespearian comedies—full of clever updates and snarky rhymes—would underserve a great tragedy, but somehow it doesn’t; though full of laughs, this \'Othello\' finds sufficient resonance in its new setting to merit the effort...Of course, this treatment can’t achieve the full pathos of the original verse; still, it is never less than inventive and even instructive in finding cognates for Shakespeare’s poetry."" ', '""Clever and exuberantly performed...The music pulses with life, and the cascading rhymes of the lyrics are often inspired. My only qualm is that the rhythms vary so rarely that a certain monotony sets in…Still, diversions keep coming, even when the tragedy reaches its climax…\'Othello: The Remix\' will probably not reduce you to tears or leave you in stunned silence. But it’s a tickling refreshment to leave a production of this dark tale with a smile on your face."" ', '""Introduces a new sound to a story of betrayal, greed, and revenge...The piece kept a high-octane, dizzying pace. The rhymes were fast. The music was pulsating. It was a concise reimagining of \'Othello\' that is nicely structured. The company has a strong comedic approach...It could have gone further and been even tighter...Nevertheless, consistency was prevalent...If you can\'t get a ticket to \'Hamilton,\' \'Othello: the Remix\' is the next best option."" ', '""They\'ve converted the remaining dialogue into rap couplets, a lot  of them quite clever…Purists will miss the Bard\'s language but others will probably get a kick out of this high-spirited production. And even in the midst of all the zaniness, Postell Pringle still manages to convey Othello\'s nobility and his folly."" ', '""They lean into the comedic side of the tragedy throughout the show, and everyone looks like they’re having a blast. Their jubilation is infectious...Though some of the jokes are repetitive or go on a bit too long, the play’s quick run time keeps this from becoming a real issue. What’s slightly more concerning is Desdemona...She’s just a disembodied vocal solo piped through the speakers...Quibbles aside, \'Othello: The Remix\' is a thoroughly entertaining way to spend an evening.""

Taken as a light-hearted romp, it is entertaining and engaging. However, don’t expect it to leave you with a fresh perspective…All the characters save Othello, Iago, and Cassio are essentially one-dimensional punch-lines; they draw laughs, but lose the human complexity."" ', '""\'The Remix\' certainly works as a fast-paced rap concert, with dramatic lighting and a fine DJ spinning while four delightful performers spit out witty couplets and execute synchronized choreography...It is the Q Brothers\' first foray into Shakespearean tragedy. And therein lies the rub...The weirdest choice is to cast Desdemona as a disembodied voice...It’s choices like this that rob us of the full force of Othello’s wrongful actions, and the full horror in his realization of what he’s done."" ', '""The four men barely take a breather while moving about and gesticulating in the now time-honored rapper manner, but something does nag about the modernizing. There’s the distinct feeling that those involved want current audiences to appreciate Shakespeare but are concerned that his language has grown to be off-putting. It hasn’t, and at no point does the replacement verse reach the supernal level of the real thing."" ', '""If the authors\' intricately rhymed verse is slickly effective in conveying the whirlwind pace of intrigue, the authors can\'t do much to invest action with much meaning…We never see Desdemona at all...Without seeing Othello together with the woman he loves, we can\'t appreciate what he loses when his faith in her is shattered…What finally cancels out the possibility of true emotional engagement is the sheer relentlessness of the verse.""

However long the run, this \'remix\' can never run long enough.""

Revised since then, it retains both its primary strengths — Hood’s music and Russell’s lyrics, though their title song is still underwhelming — and its fatal weaknesses: Russell’s strained plot and sitcom-shallow dialogue, and a central character so self-absorbed that you have to wonder what Lou, who is a catch, sees in her.

If you are looking for a night of music and a story that will bring you to tears...see \'Marie and Rosetta.\'"" ', '""Even when \'Marie and Rosetta\' seems to be about little more than getting the act together, it makes for a fine 90 minutes, thanks to some salty dialogue and sizzling vocals, courtesy of two magnificently equipped actresses...Neil Pepe, the director, handles these slender dramatic goods with extreme delicacy, extracting two finely shaded performances that nevertheless make room for some galvanic vocals, backed by the excellent guitarist Felicia Collins and pianist Deah Harriott."" ', '""Even if \'Marie and Rosetta\' occasionally gets grounded in clunky exposition, this 90-minute piece soars whenever these ultra-talented ladies get to sing. The \'score\' is comprised primarily of real-life gospel standards and, regardless of your religion or belief system, anyone with an appreciation for great music will end up in heaven during these passages...Director Neil Pepe has guided the proceedings with a smooth hand."" ', '""In director Neil Pepe’s sly, expert chamber musical, Lewis and Jones don’t just portray the women on what appears to be their first rehearsal...These actors also sing, whisper and wail the wonderful songs — including \'This Train\' and \'Down by the Riverside\' — and are so convincing at the piano and guitar that it’s hard to believe they are not playing. Fairness demands that credit goes to Felicia Collins and Deah Harriott behind the scrim."" ', '""Brandt is a gifted storyteller and the 90 minutes without intermission are mesmerizing...Brandt includes a satisfying twist in telling the story of how the woman who once was a big enough celebrity to fill a baseball stadium for her third wedding ended up forgotten and buried in an unmarked grave. I felt grateful that Brandt has brought her back to life for us...And the music is heavenly. I felt as though I had attended a worship service."" ', '""George Brant’s drama, unsentimentally directed by Neil Pepe, is peppered with evocative detail, and it incorporates its biographical material gracefully...Rosetta’s incipient mentorship of Marie is capably rendered...Lewis and Jones sing superbly…As the play goes on, the dialogue starts to seem more and more like segues between musical numbers, but it’s hard to complain. You don’t have to be religious to know when you’re in the presence of glory."" ', '""Brant\'s story is essentially a framing device for a terrific, concert—a concert vibrant enough to make even non-gospel fans tap their feet and applaud after each number. The music may even make you forgive the playwright\'s contrived trick ending...Lewis and Jones make this two-hander soar dramatically as well as musically. Both are fine actors and have big belting vocals...By the time the two women actually sing and play together the show really rocks."" ', '""The story of Rosetta and her stage partner Marie is brought to vivid life, but their music is what steals the show...The exposition is rather clunky. But the performances are remarkable...Rosetta was a child prodigy on the gospel circuit and Lewis sings her like the second coming. Rebecca Naomi Jones is equally gifted as the younger Marie...Director Pepe wisely allows the music to carry the day. With this much talent, when these ladies get cooking, it\'s a religious experience.""  ', '""A brash and swaggering new play with music from the Atlantic...Stage vet Kecia Lewis is wised-up, earthy and soulful as the flamboyant performer who has both a matronly concern for her new charge and something of a sensual draw to her, as well. Rebecca Naomi Jones, as Marie, is initially timid, but Sister Rosetta draws her out, helping her walk a line between faith and seductiveness."" ', '""Both actresses have excellent singing voices and make full use of them…The only shortcoming in the work comes with the story itself...While the story provides a nice introduction to who these people were, it never really goes below the surface in examining the life of either. These quibbles aside, \'Marie and Rosetta\' offers both a tuneful, entertaining time at the theater and a look at two interesting figures in 20th-century music."" ', '""Lewis and Jones bring it all home in song after song…If the conversation between the two women never approaches the excitement of their singing, the playwright is adept at establishing the distinctiveness of their personalities…Late in the play, there is an eye-rolling twist…As shopworn as it is, it doesn’t spoil the service that George Brant has rendered by retrieving these figures for the stage, nor the rousing musical performances that are the heart of ‘Marie and Rosetta.\'"" ', '""A swift and enjoyable bio-drama…Rebecca Naomi Jones and Kecia Lewis are both fine singing actors who are giving excellent performances…While a dramatic twist at the end doesn\'t quite land, it works as a vehicle to provide information about what happened to the two later in life. If ‘Marie and Rosetta’ is somewhat lacking in storytelling, the excitement of watching Jones and Lewis whole-heartedly present a taste of their artistry is well worth a visit."" ', '""Playwright George Brant has written a perfunctory script about the first rehearsal of this legendary team, but since the biographical details are so thin, it’s all about the glorious voices…As a story framework, it’s corny as hell, but it works well enough to support the singers and their celestial voices. Lewis is a force of nature, and when she unleashes her powerhouse voice on rockin’ versions of gospel classics the church roof elevates."" ', '""It emerges as a thin if likable drama that enables us to enjoy the main attractions, the terrific singing by Kecia Lewis as Tharpe and Rebecca Naomi Jones as Knight...The dialogue between the women can get sharp at times...But the singing is the real treat...Directed with feeling by Neil Pepe, it is an impressive tribute to the two singers who contributed so much to the musical world with their creativity, performing and recording."" ', '""There’s a sea change. We’re not exactly where or when we thought we were. The idea is good, the transition bumpy, dialogue less secure. \'Marie and Rosetta\' is musically entertaining and well written to that point. Both actresses do a fine job, with Rebecca Naomi Jones excelling in the outsized, yet devout role...Director Neil Pepe does an adroit job of giving the women small natural business and of indicating changes in their relationship...Pacing is deft."" ', '""George Brant\'s two-hander purports to tell the story of that relationship. I say purports because his plot is thin, and his story employs a lot of poetic license...But none of that matters because what gives this show its heart, and yes, its soul, is the music. There are few things more glorious than a well-sung gospel song and this show has a bunch of them. It also has two superb performances from Rebecca Naomi Jones as Marie and Kecia Lewis as Rosetta."" ', '""Neil Pepe\'s direction is unassuming, freeing Lewis and Jones to feed off each other\'s energy...The actresses\' main obstacles are the thin and sometimes artificial emotional arcs they\'re given, so they tend to hide behind their characters\' postures...Beyond the warmth of its leads and the spiritedness of its music — and despite its paucity of dramatic tension — the greatest virtue of \'Marie and Rosetta\' is the rarely told history it illuminates."" ', '""Music, more than the rather slender threads of bio-drama, forms the spine and provides the allure in ‘Marie and Rosetta\'…Fortunately, there is plenty of music to divert us when the dialogue dawdles. Both Ms. Lewis and Ms. Jones have beautiful voices, and they do blend smoothly...Because the music is roof-raising, I would have preferred to tip the balance more toward songs...‘Marie and Rosetta’ sometimes sags, but when it sings, it really swings.""

Fiorello!,"['""The first full-scale New York revival and the first Off-Broadway production ever, The Berkshire Theatre Group’s staging of the Bock and Harnick musical \'Fiorello!\' has moved to New York’s East 13th Street Theater from Stockbridge, Massachusetts. This delightful production proves that not only is this rarely revived show still fresh and witty, but that with its young and vital cast, it is still a captivating, heartwarming evening in the theater."" ', '""Powered by a notably youthful cast, the production has a sunny-spirited exuberance...For a tiny band, the score retains its bounce, its bite, its frisky melodic charm, thanks to the musicianship of the players and principals alike...It’s not hard to see why \'Fiorello!\' remains cherished today mostly for its score...\'Fiorello!\' lacks a strong narrative arc, which may explain why it has never been revived on Broadway."" ', '""A timely work...Despite having an absolutely superlative score, \'Fiorello!\' is rarely performed, which could be the result of its book (which is well-crafted but bulky)...The photogenic actors look as if they just graduated from college. And while Austin Scott Lombardi shows considerable pep and drive in the title role, he hardly resembles \'The Little Flower\' physically. Under the direction of Bob Moss, the production is full of tender emotion, dramatically effective and highly enjoyable."" ', '""\'Fiorello!\' is a terrific piece of writing, with adroit direction, artful visuals, droll choreography, and a company of notably young, talented players—a veritable treat. Getting past their youth takes a minute. After that, it’s clear sailing...The show is warm, tuneful, charming, wry, and wise. You’ll have a good time. Director Bob Moss stages with great freshness and an eye to visuals. The large cast moves seamlessly from scene to scene as does furniture. Pacing is nimble."" ', '""Taken what is in essence an old-fashioned and somewhat creaky show and whipped it up into a sprightly and engaging concoction...What makes this \'Fiorello!\' even more winning is the fresh-faced group of twentysomethings who comprise the show’s talented cast. It’s a wonderfully appealing group...As for the show itself, its main attraction as a piece is the splendid score...Quibbles aside, this is a production that no fan of classic musical theater will want to miss."" ', '""With a youthful, fresh-faced cast and no-frills staging by Bob Moss, it feels like good summer stock...Moss directs the show with Shakespearean fluidity, allowing one scene to seamlessly flow into the next...While the underscoring occasionally feels thin, the vocals never do...Parts of the show come off as passé, but it\'s hard not to be charmed by Bock and Harnick\'s hummable melodies, delivered by an enthusiastic cast. You\'ll be singing the numbers all the way home."" ', '""The music by Bock and witty lyrics of Harnick are chief attractions...Directed by Bob Moss, the enthusiastic company puts plenty of spirit into the show...Despite the appealing acting by Austin Scott Lombardi in the title role, it must be faced that he looks nothing like LaGuardia...The book can get heavy at times, true also in the original...But whatever quibbles one may find here, this staging is an admirable, welcomely enjoyable opportunity to see this show."" ', '""All in all, the young talented BTG performers seem a little on the young side (because they are) to portray some of the roles, but their talent and enthusiasm overshadow...Highlight performances come from Chelsea Cree Groen as Dora, Rebecca Brudner as Thea, Rylan Morsbach as Ben, as well as Lombardi as LaGuardia...The clever songs and lyrics keep the audience enamored, the timeliness of political corruption always on the money (no pun intended)."" ', '""It seems an ideal time for New York’s first fully staged revival of \'Fiorello,\' a musical that celebrates a politician who walked the walk and talked the talk...A confident Austin Scott Lombardi leads the cast of 20-something actors, wearing the suspenders of the \'Little Flower,\' a half-Italian, half-Jewish, 5-foot-2 politico...The BTG’s transfer is sweet, lively and timely."" ', '""There are marvelous songs and excellent performances in this production that make it worth seeing. The period costumes, choreography and sets will impress you. Some of the bad accents will make you cringe. However, it is not every day, every year, or even every decade that you get to catch a full-scale production of \'Fiorello!\' So I highly recommend you take this opportunity to see it. Sure, it\'s far from perfect but you will still have a very good time and be glad you went."" ', '""With such a young cast, fairly simple sets and staging, this \'Fiorello!\' feels a bit more like a very good college production...It\'s still terrifically charming and enjoyable, though, and expect to see the careers of Lombardi, Birenboim, and McLean flourish in the future. Although \'Fiorello!\' is not quite as strong as many of the other often-produced musicals of the famed 1950s era, it\'s a great musical for this moment...It is a refreshing little tonic during this heated political season."" ', '""Struggles—and sometimes succeeds—in finding relevancy nearly 60 years later...Despite the problematic Golden Age-style writing and the less-than-consistent dialect work, there are a few performances that stick with you...All in all, this is a thoughtful and effective production of material that may feel dated in 2016. And it is certainly a visually and musically lovely piece of theater—the singing is close to flawless, the choreography works perfectly, and Moss creates striking stage pictures."" ', '""The songs and the staging tell a story that is both popular and inspiring. The current production has some amazing strengths and modern moments. The cast, in general, is quite proficient but many of the actors have diction and accent issues. Overall, it\'s amazing to see a full staging of \'Fiorello!\'. Enjoy the songs and the dancing, see some very promising young talent and marvel at the fact so little has changed in the political scene in the last century."" ', '""Refreshing as the cast\'s youthful zest is, the shortcomings of their performances and the staging—as well as George Abbott and Jerome Weidman\'s book—loom bigger in New York. I\'ve never been fond of two piano arrangements for big musicals, and the hardly heard violin that\'s the second instrument here made me more wishful than to hear Bock\'s melodies with a bigger sound...Best moments are when the entire cast is singing and dancing to one of the dreamy songs."" ', '""\'Fiorello!\' was already a period piece in 1959. This production depends on its fresh-faced cast and its music and musicians being scrupulously true to the time to slip you right into the play...There is charm and wit in the lyrics. Still...the wit in \'Fiorello!\' has an antiquated, \'let’s-not-ask-too-much-of-our-audience\' feel...This production is entirely authentic...The cast all seem to be about the same age so on occasion they struggle to cover all the character demands.""  ', '""Moss’ adroit staging fits nicely into the intimate confines of the space, as does Michael Callahan’s often bouncy choreography...Where Moss apparently succeeded most importantly is in guiding his cast into performances that abound with confidence and bravura. What he can’t give them is the seasoning and depth that generally come with experience, the kind of seasoning that the script and many of the musical numbers demand to be fully realised."" ', '""A rewarding evening—but one where you may find yourself making allowances...It’s still a gripping political and romantic tale...And, bless us all, it’s all punctuated with the music of Jerry Bock and the lyrics of Sheldon Harnick...It’s a youthful cast, sometimes disconcertingly so...Director Bob Moss might want to encourage his cast to dig down deeper into characterization...Berkshire’s \'Fiorello!\' plays like a good college production of the show."" ', '""The idealism underpinning Abbot and Weidman’s original book is heightened by this very young cast. It’s fun to watch these youthful performers take on New York stereotypes of old usually fleshed out by seasoned character actors, but each of these \'kids\' is of fully developed voice, so the wonderful songs with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick get the full expression they deserve."" ', '""What is to celebrate here is Harnick and Bock\'s work, equally for its melodic sophistication as for the clarion singing of the cast of this revival. Every note, every lyric is beautifully produced by the troupe, whether simply singing or also executing frequently charming choreography. I ought to mention, however, the detriments...The book is thin...As the director of this revival, Robert Moss lacks Abbott’s knack. Here the tuner’s sketchiness is made manifest."" ', '""Would have been better left in the Berkshire Hills...Bock and Harnick\'s score is nearly as good as those for \'Fiddler\' and \'She Loves Me,\' and it\'s always a pleasure to hear it again...The biggest problem with this \'Fiorello!\' is the cast--bright, fresh-faced young people, trained in all the requisite musical theatre skills...They thoroughly fail to suggest the rough-and-tumble New York of the early 20th century...The best thing about this production is its design."" ', '""The small-scale Berkshire production is played by a likable ensemble of actors in their 20s, many of whom are too young to play their meaty character roles...There is certainly cleverness in Moss\' staging, and set designer Carl Sprague\'s cut-outs of Manhattan skyscrapers and street signs look great...\'Fiorello!\' is a fine musical deserving of a professional New York staging. While this new mounting isn\'t a bad one, it\'s essentially a college-level production charging Off-Broadway prices."" ', '""Their melodic score, brimming over with warm but sharp humor, retains its charm...The book is decidedly old-fashioned, and somewhat clunky by present-day standards...Decidedly \'summer stock\'...Up on the Straw Hat circuit, this \'Fiorello!\' might have seemed like a bright and endearing summer’s night diversion. Down here on 13th Street, it seems a welcome way to form an acquaintance with Bock & Harnick’s Pulitzer-winner but not exactly up to professional standards."" ', '""The cast of \'Fiorello\' was young, attractive, eager and talented, but not polished...The movement seemed forced, particularly since Michael Callahan\'s choreography throughout the show was mediocre and the dancing not very good. Bob Moss\'s staging is fluid and effective though everyone needed more character work...Worth seeing if you\'ve never seen \'Fiorello\' or if, like me, you love the score and were hungry for a revival."" ', '""The show itself lacks a narrative arc; I can\'t shake the fact that we simply glaze over so many important issues...The cast is made up of mostly young actors who are making their debut. You can feel the energy bounce off them, which was refreshing, but that can’t save the script...\'Fiorello\' is a nice musical that has beautiful choreography and catchy songs, but at the end of the day makes you question if we are actually doing anything to make our world a better place."" ', '""Everyone looks far too young, and no one has either the gravitas or rough edges to embody the older roles or the versatility called for when playing several. Given the show’s gangsterish background, it’s like watching ‘Bugsy Malone,’ in which prepubescent actors played mobsters and molls, only now they look like college kids. There are some fine female voices, but most of the acting is only passable; no one is truly distinctive, but Groen and Morsbach show great promise.""

', '""It is a show that exists almost entirely to let its star blaze to her heart’s content. The light she casts is so dazzling, this seems an entirely sufficient reason to be...What was one of the great stage performances of the 20th century has been reinvented, in terms both larger and more intimate, that may well guarantee its status as one the great stage performances of this century, too...The musical, on the other hand, seems and sounds thin, despite the velveteen lushness of its orchestra."" ', '""Glenn Close makes it look effortless...The songs work together flawlessly, setting up the thesis and then proving it, all the while Close bewitching you as surely as Norma does her cherished \'people in the dark\'...Whether \'Sunset Boulevard\' is everything a musical is supposed to be is another matter. It plays very well, though in most part because it follows Wilder\'s prescriptions (and dialogue) closely...Price\'s attempts at taming this beast are valiant and largely successful."" ', '""Close delivers as if no time has gone by at all. Joined by a 40-piece orchestra, we\'re privileged to witness theater history in the making...Price\'s discombobulating staging, which often features his actors running up and down the Escher stairs to nowhere, doesn\'t really achieve a feeling of intimacy...All bets are off when Close hits the stage...It\'s not cliché to say that we can hear a pin drop during each number as she commands the spotlight in triumph."" ', '""The production cuts back on the gargantuan sets, but in doing so it restores the essence of the story which is that everything should rely on Norma’s face. And what a face! Close easily morphs into whatever the situation calls for...What’s truly remarkable about her work here is she is able to communicate a myriad of emotions without the aid of closeups, her singing, her body language, and the larger than life expressions force us to zoom into her, as if we almost didn’t have a choice."" ', '""Close is totally centered and zeroed-in on the script and score…She is even better now that she was in 1994…Close was 47 when she debuted the show on Broadway, which means that 70 is now not far away. And yet, that makes Norma’s need that much greater…The Greatest Orchestra on Broadway embellished with symphony-level sound ‘The Greatest Star of All’ and all the other potent Lloyd Webber-Black-Hampton songs."" ', '""Close acknowledges the decades of high camp baked into Desmond’s glittery delusions. But even as she plays them for laughs, she digs for the pathos too. Whether mourning her dead pet chimpanzee, begging her recalcitrant lover not to leave, or drawing out the money notes from Lloyd Weber’s lavish score, she takes care to keep her hands cupped around the tender flame of humanity that still flickers somewhere beneath all the brittle melodrama."" ', '""Glenn Close makes a triumphant return to the star role of Norma Desmond...Some roles you really have to grow into, and Close claims diva status this time around...Lloyd Webber’s luscious music (burdened by clunky lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton) is performed by a huge on-stage orchestra that lives by its strings...Close delivers a genuine show-stopper in \'As If We Never Said Goodbye\'...If you want to see grown men weeping in the aisles, this is your moment."" ', '""Close delivers a more subtle, nuanced performance well suited to a production dramatically scaled down from the original...The lush orchestrations do ample justice to the beauty of Lloyd Webber’s score...The book by Christopher Hampton and Don Black is largely faithful to the film, although its lack of nuance sometimes gives the musical an excessively campy feel that thankfully is now lessened...Ultimately, it’s Close’s return that is this revival’s reason for being."" ', '“Glenn Close is better than ever…This revival may be more Encores style concert than the ornately staged original, but it\'s big in all the right ways…This is Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s best and richest score. Instead of one much reprised ear-clinger, he\'s written several show-stoppers…All this is not to say that Close\'s Norma, though touchingly vulnerable and doesn\'t make for a story that\'s overly melodramatic, incredible and old-fashioned."" ', '""Although her voice sounded a bit pinched at times, her Norma Desmond is one for the ages. She is joined by a fine supporting cast...Instead of lavish sets, we get a 40-piece orchestra onstage.

If you do not appreciate Andrew Lloyd Webber’s music, you might not.""

But that is a quibble. This is a hugely entertaining musical and a chance to enjoy the artistry of Glenn Close at the height of her stage power.""

There are some deeply silly passages...Still, the show holds together and Close is every ounce the star she is playing."" ', '""Glenn Close is this generation’s Shirley Jones...She has mastered the art of bringing controlled madness to her method. Of all the big names attached to this production, the most important is Billy Wilder. The 1950 film which he co-wrote and directed is so chock full of bullet-proof source material, it is impossible not to be entertained by any decent adaptation...Mr. Johanson is fabulous as Max, with his deep voice miraculously ranging into falsetto territory."" ', '""Aside from the enormous orchestra—and perhaps a bulbous chandelier that makes the one from \'Phantom\' seem like a toddler’s night light—there’s little here to distract from Close’s mesmerizing Norma, or Lloyd Webber’s pop friendly score...Michael Xavier stands out as writer Joe Gillis...The musical is over the top, and we remain head over heels for Close’s so-very-delicate Norma Desmond."" ', '""Director Lonny Price has come up with a daring new production concept...Andrew Lloyd Webber has given her lush melodies, and Don Black’s and Christopher Hampton’s lyrics rise to the occasion whenever she bursts into song...Close gives an epic performance from start to finish, and reminds us just how powerful such great work can be...The story of \'Sunset Boulevard\' is solid, but its supporting characters are not written with the same perception and depth of its leading lady."" ', '""The material, it turns out, is pretty sturdy. And with a more seasoned Glenn Close bringing new nuance to her interpretation of Norma, it offers ample spectacle of a different kind: the spectacle of unhinged megalomania and vanity. Better yet, it offers the biggest orchestra on Broadway...Lloyd Webber really did himself proud with this one...Close plays these big moments, and all of Norma’s many others, with an intelligence and imagination rare among divas."" ', '""Despite Close\'s tour-de-force performance, director Lonny Price\'s skilled direction keeps the other performances from being lost in the sweep of one of Norma\'s many flowing, glittering outfits...The score sounds fabulous thanks to the huge 40-piece orchestra which takes up the rear of the stage...While Close\'s performance is stunning, her singing voice is less than optimal, especially in the higher ranges."" ', '""Trimmed, scaled down and economically revitalized by director Lonny Price, the old opulence stripped of its glamour...It is clear from her first entrance down that treacherous staircase looking like a drag queen who owns the stage...The magic Close conjures of the brevity of fame is as rare on the proscenium stage today as that 40-piece orchestra. Her experience, knowledge and craft prove that \'Sunset Boulevard\' is an old warhorse that can still finish the race in first place.""

Spoon River,"['""One of the most memorable and transformative theatrical moments I have experienced in live theater. Indeed, from start to glorious finish this production is truly what the best of live theater is about...This incredible production holds many beautiful truths. They begin and end in artistic genius; with the unified elements of brilliant music, the sterling voices of the talented, superb actors, the musicianship of cast members, the enlightened adaptation by Schultz of Edgar Lee Masters’ work."" ', '""An inclusive, but lavish display of what theatre is about; both reflecting and inspiring humanity...\'The Graves,\' \'Couples,\' and \'Soul Alive\' are just a few of the gorgeous, roaring tracks that ignite audience’s imaginations...The cast of \'Spoon River\' is absolutely exceptional. Each person shines in voice and talent...I cannot describe the sentimentality of this musical, and how it has become one of the best shows to see in New York."" ', '""In this version of \'Spoon River Anthology,\' those souls are brought back to life in a sizzling thrill ride that packs quite a punch...It’s a brilliant piece of theater–the kind you might one day look back on and remember as one of the best things you ever saw. Soulpepper’s production is the perfect storm of elements yielding a theatrical ne plus ultra...The cast is a wonderment. All (or nearly so) are multi-instrumentalists who sing well, move well, emote brilliantly and make astounding music."" ', '""I detest most musicals, but this one I loved. The music was genuine and of high quality...Clearly the composer is fully at home in setting Masters’ irregular free verse...The various members of the cast showed what splendid, resourceful, gutsy actors and singers they are, as they led us to some very dark places...This was a richly entertaining, deeply moving celebration of life...One cannot sufficiently praise the consistently brilliant and committed cast and all participants."" ', '""This adaptation is top-notch, honoring the original poems of Edgar Lee Masters yet giving them a freshness and vitality that reverberates with authenticity and reflects the mid-World War I fears of mortality and survival. Albert Schultz’s staging is strong and exceptional and Mike Ross’s music is emotionally rich, passionate, and often mesmerizing. The ensemble cast seems to welcome the music into the depth of their sinews and delivers the songs with riveting and polished performances."" ', '""This exhilarating, 95-minute musical features 19 top-flight actor-musicians, including the versatile Ross...Much of the score of \'Spoon River\' has a classic country sound...All of it is appealing and much of it beautiful...Ross, Schultz, and the Spoon River company have transformed Masters\' morose masterpiece into a gift of joy for New York. Let\'s hope the Soulpepper crew will plant their maple leaf flag in the Big Apple on a frequent basis."" ', '""A kind of all-souls hootenanny...\'Spoon River\' is a feel-good show, a memento mori only in that it encourages its audiences to gather their rosebuds while they may. What’s most impressive here is the diversity of Mr. Ross’s songs and Mr. Schultz’s staging, and the ingenuity with which they match character to melody and stance...The production is a shade overstuffed and repetitive...Still, there’s a winning generosity in having these alternatives."" ', '""A lively, joyful musical adaptation...Much of what Ross has composed is what used to be called hillbilly music, but that doesn’t do justice to the range of genres and the depth of talent that put them over...There is humor lurking in the grim tales and sad regrets voiced by individual characters...If the pile-on of graveyard observers starts to feel too rich, and the songs too repetitive, what will surely remain a fond memory after theatergoers depart are the rompin’, stompin’ hootenannies."" ', '""Composer Mike Ross has set several of Masters’s poems to rollicking, foot-stomping tunes...Adapters Albert Schultz (who also directs) and Ross have selected a sweet bouquet from the anthology’s 244 poems...In a universally strong cast, a few performers match their material so perfectly it’s nearly painful...Still, the most powerful moments are the massed ones, when the company fills the stage. The volume alone of so many people in so small a space is thrilling."" ', '""A mash-up of tone poem and folk opera...Although there’s almost no interaction among the singing corpses, a portrait – complex, rich and varied as life – does emerge. Credit for this goes not only to the ingenious staging but to an exceptionally talented roster of actors, at once united and varied. That’s perhaps the most salient element on display in this Soulpepper bonanza: a unity of purpose and commitment from artists who have grown together."" ', '""A stellar and talented group of actors are there singing and saying what they need to say...It’s a show about death and dying, but you’d never know by the liveliness and exuberance the music and the cast give off. There are too many wonderful moments and songs to even try to categorize...The whole piece just has such tremendous fun with death, that one can’t help but celebrate along with them the great gift of life...A joyous ninety minutes.""

All in all \'Spoon River\' is a joyful and fitting production.""

I was hoping for focus, or a point of view."" ', 'for a previous production""A celebration of the power of theatre, the joy of performing and the sublime art of collaboration...The way that Mike Ross’s music reaches inside our spirits and takes us to a dozen different places is an act of sheer theatrical legerdemain...Every last member of the company is brilliant...You will be hard-pressed not to levitate from your seat with sheer emotion....\'Spoon River\' is a once-in-a-lifetime show. See it, hear it, celebrate it."" ', 'for a previous production""Vocally thrilling, this current production captivates our hearts and emotions and soars through the rafters with impeccably controlled precision and timing...I do have a slight quibble with the text, nevertheless, as these numerous glimpses and brief looks into the backstories become a jumble in trying to make connections to the characters.  It is only a minute quibble as the musical score paints an emotional landscape through song...There is a state of grace in each performance."" ', 'for a previous production""Masters’ poems are substantial enough to work dramatically, yet simple enough to be understood when sung or spoken rather than read. It’s a further strength that many of them are spoken; Ross’s musical settings are brilliant, and stylistically varied, but they’re all the more effective for not being continuous...If one of the functions of an adaptation is to send you back to the original — well, this one did that for me, and what I found was richer than I’d remembered."" ', 'for a previous production""While not every number succeeds, you’ll lose count of the many magical moments...Ross’s music—a blend of reels, slow waltzes, honky-tonk numbers and ebullient toe-tapping dance songs, played and sung by the large company—is a treat, too. The design is wonderfully atmospheric, Ken MacKenzie’s moonlit space of trees and rounded steps allowing the characters, in Erika Connor’s period costumes, to flow smoothly in and out of the action."" ', 'for a previous production""By and large, I really enjoyed the music for this show...The actors sing with a bit of a rasp and a country twang. The music is much grittier than what you’re used to hearing in the theatre and it feels all the more earnest for it...I do feel that ‘Spoon River’ loses out a bit by not having much of an arc. The show went by very quickly...I liked watching it and would recommend it. But it’s a shame that to me this was a great show that falls short of being truly exceptional."" ', 'for a previous production""Schultz has marshalled a number of memorable images with a few versatile set pieces...While it’s wonderful to have such a large cast on stage, Schultz is better at showing us the trees than the forest—and the larger numbers sometimes feel like poetry in commotion...My consistent quibble with Ross’s overall project is that poems are not lyrics—and no matter how sensitive his settings, the words sometimes jar with the music...‘Spoon River’ works, nevertheless; it’s even magical.""

', '""\'Songbird\' has a very broad appeal and will please theatre lovers and country music fans as the production combines an intriguing story with excellent music. See this theatrical gem."" ', '""Playwright Michael Kimmel and songwriter Lauren Pritchard gambled by setting \'Songbird\', their adaptation of \'The Seagull\' inside a messy nest of contemporary Nashville musicians. But the resulting work is a fervent theatrical experience that deserves a long, happy future…Engaging performances are delivered by just about everybody…Pritchard’s remarkably diverse score both explicates character and shapes conflict.” ', '""This musical is one of my favorite shows of the past month...\'Songbird\' unfolds so naturally as though it wasn’t informed by a play from the late 1800s; it appears to operate entirely on its own, with catchy country music to boot. I’m not normally a big fan of that genre but I eagerly ate up all the music presented here. I can’t wait for the next incarnation of this musical."" ', '""\'Songbird\' stands fully on its own, without any knowledge of \'The Seagull\' required to understand or enjoy the show. J.V. Mercanti, the Director, has done an admirable job working with a great set of actors, who happen to be talented musicians. \'Songbird\' is a great piece."" ', '""Do you like country music? I don’t…unless I’m listening to it, and, boy, did I like \'Songbird.\' With original music and lyrics by Lauren Pritchard and a flavorful book by Michael Kimmel, \'Songbird\' is as original a musical as they come...With a uniformly excellent ten-member cast, most of whom also play one or more instruments, the twangy singing, snappy stepping and relationship-rich story come together seamlessly...At two hours, including intermission, \'Songbird\' is just right."" ', '""For all the connections with Chekhov, and all the story’s rich complexities of pure art and commerce, love and jealousy, betrayal and death, the tone of \'Songbird\' lifts off from the moody symbolism of Chekhov’s play into its own joy, rising on the wings of songs wonderful at the time they’re heard, though hard to remember after, and a clever, witty book. I have to think that – once he caught on to the idea — Chekhov would have loved \'Songbird.\'"" ', '""\'Songbird\' proves to be one of the more successful attempts to transpose Chekhov’s major plays...Powered by a terrific country score, with a strong assist from Kimmel’s smart contemporary version of the text, the show succeeds in snugly reframing the story in the world of country music...Under the finely honed direction of JV Mercanti, all the performers are excellent...The production makes up in earthy humor what it may lack in emotional depth."" ', '""\'Songbird\' is not only an excellent Americanized version of the Chekhov classic but works beautifully in its own right. If it has any flaws, it is that it could use more ideas beyond its source material. Even though the plot will be familiar to those who know \'The Seagull,\' it is still a moving, engrossing musical experience. Incidentally, the bird that Dean accidentally kills here is a bluebird, more fitting for a Nashville story."" ', '""Under JV Mercanti\'s direction the cast sails from song to dialogue to song. The show overall projects the sense of a much fuller, run down, smoke-filled honky tonk bar in Nashville...There isn\'t an actor involved in the various sub plots who doesn\'t at several points grab a guitar and burst into a rousing melody...But for all its fun, \'Songbird\' does end sadly. The little bluebird that Dean finds is after all an omen — and Kimmel and Prichard\'s big-little musical exists courtesy of Chekhov\'s... ', '""While respecting Chekhov’s story, Kimmel’s scenario, realised smartly under JV Mercanti’s knowing direction, clips along briskly, avoiding the sense of ennui that often colours the staging of Chekhov’s plays. Pritchard’s score further keeps things lively with a variety of tempos and moods, while remaining within the country and western realm..It stands on its own as an engaging piece of musical theatre."" ', '""The show is infused with country music, sung and played by the actors. The music not only keeps the play skipping along where a true Chekov play would be rambling, it also intensifies the emotional messages. As the old saying goes, when you can\'t say it, sing it... This may be the most spirited play with music onstage in a long time."" ', '""So if you’ve seen \'The Seagull,\' there might not seem to be much point in your attending \'Songbird\' as well, since the musical breaks no new ground and won’t really add to your understanding of the human condition – except for one thing: the cast of \'Songbird\' is absolutely superb and they have done a terrific job with the material they have been given.""  ', '""It’s a little musical with a big heart…Michael Kimmel has done a fantastic job at translating the grandness of \'The Seagull\' into a two hour show that is modern, relatable, and features great parts...\'Songbird’s\' compact nature does result in some heavy-handed moments and the whole thing feels slightly incomplete... But overall the story channels the overwhelming sadness of \'The Seagull\' and adds in a little more laughter…Lauren Pritchard’s beautiful music is the reason to see \'Songbird.\'"" ', '""The first act is the strongest, featuring duets and solo numbers that offer an intimate look at the characters’ lives and loves. Act two gets more crowded, since most of the large cast is onstage for much of it, leading to a final scene that feels abrupt…Writer Michael Kimmel has taken great pains with this bird…Ultimately, this ambitious project stands and sings on its own, and Kimmel, Pritchard, and director JV Mercanti make it work."" ', '""If your heart, unlike mine, leaps up at the prospect of \'The Seagull\' retooled as a Grand Ole Opry-style musical set in a Tennessee bar, then \'Songbird\' is for you...Chekhov\'s characters and the emotions they unleash are universal. No matter what the setting into which they\'re plopped, they retain the Russian playwright\'s dramedy impact. Of course, that\'s if they\'re well played, which, it\'s a pleasure to say, they are."" ', '""Truly, though, this is an ensemble effort, and everyone contributes 110 percent. I do believe, however, that the overall production would have been strengthened by using Chekhov as inspiration rather than as a template. As it stands, too much emphasis has been placed on staying true to \'The Seagull,\' leading to predictable and melodramatic plot turns. Despite a slew of first-rate performances, \'Songbird\' needs some breathing room of its own in order to soar."" ', '""Pritchard pens warm, catchy tunes, performed with casual ease by the talented cast. The large ensemble genuinely seems to be having fun with each other in JV Mercanti\'s likable production…Kimmel doesn’t do the greatest job of blending music and story...He has given himself the unenviable task of trying to condense the plot of a four-act Russian classic—and it does feel squeezed."" ', '""The requisite themes of \'The Seagull\' are threaded throughout and each character created in beautiful detail. There’s an enormous amount of talent in the cast and they are ably directed…\'Songbird\' doesn’t quite thrill. The concept is promising, the actors beautifully cast and clearly interesting, but the music and lyrics are predictable. Somehow the country and western conceit pulls \'The Seagull\' into cliché...Nevertheless, it’s a worthwhile experience, created with heart and talent."" ', '""The plot sticks very closely to Chekhov’s original, so the question becomes does the Russian classic work in this new setting? The surprising answer is yes, if mostly because of the heel-tapping music...In between the songs there’s a lot of wistful talking and whiskey drinking – again reminiscent of Chekhov... Entertaining as this all is, it’s hard to engage too deeply in the characters’ fate, and there are moments when you wish they would all just stop talking and do what they do best: sing."" ', '""Chekhov’s delicate interplay among characters and his reliance on subtextual psychological themes become soap opera theatrics and sudden, superficial, emotional blowups. Covering up the lack of believable transitions and interplay are Ms. Pritchard’s sprightly and even moving songs, mostly C&W but also including blues and rock; the songs are mostly stand-alone and don\'t help further the plot, as in more conventional musicals. But they\'re probably the strongest reason for visiting \'Songbird.\'"" ', '""The book is effective and the songs soar. There\'s just one problem: they don\'t add up to a musical. The entire score is diegetic, which doesn\'t have to be a negative, but in this case it is...The more I think about it, the more I would prefer to see an evening just of Lauren Pritchard\'s work, sung by those terrific singers. \'The Seagull\' plot kinda got in the way."" ', '""With gorgeous original songs, \'Songbird\' is an attractive, albeit sleepy new musical with a distinctively American sound...While the musical performances are spot-on, Michael Kimmel\'s book scenes make a twee first impression that eventually fades to maudlin...director J.V. Mercanti is never able to push beyond the theme park artifice of the script, leading to our somewhat shallow connection to the story and characters."" ', '""Without previous knowledge of the source material, you’d be scratching your head trying to piece together a plot…It’s a shame that the structure of the text prevents \'Songbird\' from soaring because Lauren Pritchard’s music is something special. …Material aside, \'Songbird\' is stacked with talent...Once the team decides whether it’s a play with music or a musical, going back to the drawing board will allow the show to fly.""

And though it’s not fully successful, it’s difficult to not admire the attempt.""

Characters are created in order to serve the songs, and the songs themselves are packed to the brim with philosophy, science, ideas. It’s poetics, not just poetry."" ', '""A wildly original, often stunningly staged musical theatre piece that, in its own sideways manner, confronts something very dark in human nature...Not everything works: as the show progresses and becomes more surreal, the staging, rather than the words, holds it together.

Most of the dozen members of the cast play their own musical instruments, which enrich the musical on many levels, including the drama; the instruments serve as symbols, and as harmonious contrast to the discord of war.""

Come From Away,"['""\'Come From Away,\' the inspiring, funny and kick-ass beautiful new musical...takes a true story that began on September 11th, 2001, and tells it in an exhilarating fashion that celebrates decency and human kindness...Director Christopher Ashley\'s production seamlessly moves from tense moments to humorous ones to unabashedly joyous ones...As long as \'Come From Away\' is playing on Broadway, I will recommend it to everyone. Everyone."" ', '""The genius of this production, which I regard as the best new musical of the season, is that from the very beginning a skilled group of 12 actors thrillingly take on assorted roles and slip in and out of the characters in a free-flowing staging...The goodhearted nature of \'Come from Away\' is at the forefront without being cloyingly sentimental...The show appeals to our finer qualities as human beings, and manages to be exuberantly entertaining at the same time."" ', '""For once a \'feel-good\' musical that also has depth and resonance! \'Come From Away\' at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre takes on one of the darkest periods in our contemporary history and spins it into a goldmine of goodwill, compassion and gentle surprises."" ', '“Its real-life story is stirring and honestly heartwarming, the tunes sound friendly to the ear, and the whirlwind staging is so smart...A visit...finds the show to be in excellent shape...This documentary-style musical is rendered with compassion, humor, and insight...The score’s rhythmic, folk-rock music, which possesses a windswept, Celtic flavor, briskly drives along these compelling doings...Everybody should see this show.” ', '""A brilliant achievement...The show makes you laugh and cry at the resiliency of the human spirit...The cast, all of whom play multiple roles, are quite simply fantastic. Christopher Ashley’s direction is letter-perfect, and Kelly Devine’s excellent musical staging includes a rousing opening sequence that helps to establish a small-town atmosphere for Gander. Alternatively funny and profoundly moving, \'Come From Away\' is a brilliant example of all that musical theater can be."" ', '“Brilliant…It is this show’s ability to surprise and touch even the most cynical, jaded New York theatergoer that makes it so unusual and emotionally powerful… In addition to the outstanding cast, expertly directed by Christopher Ashley, there is innovative choreography by Kelly Devine…A musical that celebrates and glorifies humanity…It’s a new type of never-before-seen, uncharted musical territory much like \'Hamilton\' was, and should also make musical-theater history."" ', '""One of the triumphs is how it so incredibly captures the culture of Newfoundland. It\'s a Canadian/Irish blend that is unlike anything we\'ve seen in theater, and everyone involved clearly went above and beyond to accurately reflect the area. The score and book, by the married couple Irene Sankoff & David Hein, sounds authentic...What makes ‘Come From Away’ work is that it displays the exceptional generosity of humanity that took place in Newfoundland. This brings to Broadway a story of hope."" ', '“It’s this truth that anchors  ‘Come From Away,’ giving it a documentary-like power that is enhanced a thousand-fold by a driving musical score, the best ensemble acting you will see on any stage this season, and direction by Ashley that doesn’t deserve a Tony Award, it deserves a Nobel Prize…The result is a work that is, considering the events it depicts, restrained, delicate, and piercing…A cry-fest and an absolutely joyful expression of what is best in the human animal: compassion.” ', '""This feel-good musical is infectious, enchanting and just what this country needs right now...Director Christopher Ashley and his amazing 12-member cast recreate the story...Each have their moment to shine but they are a true ensemble...It is hard not to be moved. Even as I am writing this I find myself choking up...\'Come From Away\' is tuneful, smart and heartfelt, and is sure to have you leaving the theatre feeling just a little bit more positive than when you entered."" ', '""The beautifully crafted musical leaves us not just feeling good, we’re transported on a wave of hope for humanity...A huge bravo to director Ashley who masterfully orchestrated the complex work...Sankoff and Hein created this wonderful work with a moving score that\'s both melodic and rousing...Every member of this extraordinary collaboration deserves the highest praise. With great warmth and humor, \'Come From Away\' is a soul-stirring antidote to the terrors we face near and far."" ', '""The book, music and lyrics are the inspired work of Irene Sankoff and David Hein. With a cast of 12 backed by eight musicians, the production, for a Broadway musical, is relatively small-scale...But all of it is managed with big-time ingenuity by director Ashley...Story theatre techniques are used to the nth degree. The performers switch characters, from townspeople to passengers and back again...There are indeed a lot of upbeat goings-on...But the darker side of the events is hardly ignored."" ', '""Should warm the heart of even the world’s worst cynic. But the musical, directed by Christopher Ashley, has much more to praise. First there’s Sankoff and Hein’s spirited score, driving, buoyant and often tuneful, with an appropriately Celtic undertone...Then there’s the tremendous acting of the 12-member ensemble...It is a musical about people who do their best in the worst of times. And for this we can only say thank you."" ', '""There are 10 new titles debuting across the year, but \'Come from Away\' towers over the rest in terms of originality and daring...Sankoff and Hein\'s folk-based score has an easy affability and an earnest sincerity. Christopher Ashley\'s production gives the show a homespun honesty, and the 12-strong ensemble company, each of whom plays multiple characters, invest it with real feeling and emotion...A musical that tells an unusual, unfamiliar 9/11 story with tact and tremendous feeling."" ', '“Despite that it is really just an excellent off-Broadway musical trying to make it in the big-time world of Broadway, it’s pretty darned good with some excellent music and a great cast of unknowns…The music...is catchy and memorable and the ensemble cast who perform all the numbers are all incredibly talented…An excellent musical…A must small-time see."" ', '“Rarely has altruism and compassion been as deeply explored and conveyed, much less in a hundred-minute musical...Music and lyrics mesh seamlessly, as the portrayals switch on a dime from townspeople to passengers and back again…A uniformly excellent cast…The show is in constant motion, with locations evoked by simple shifts in alignment of chairs. You’re never in doubt about where you are, and for the duration of ‘Come from Away’ you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.” ', '""Why do you go to theater? Because it’s entertaining and fun. Because it opens your heart, teaches life lessons and transports you to another time, another place. Because, occasionally, it conveys the essential goodness and resiliency of the human spirit at the same, shared moment in time. That’s why I stood up and cheered...Director Ashley cleverly utilizes his talented cast of 12...The crowd-pleasing performance fittingly concludes on a life-affirming note."" ', '""Will make you laugh and cry and restore your faith in humanity...This Canadian export, written by the husband and wife team of Irene Sankoff and David Hein, and directed by Christopher Ashley, comes at a time when divisiveness is far more prevalent than inclusivity, where countries talk about building walls rather than building bridges...It’s one you won’t want to miss. If you see just one show on Broadway this season, this should be it."" ', '""This show has gorgeous music and lyrics. It is the CD I can’t wait to own...This show is entertaining, uplifting and sweet. It was the perfect afternoon out and a show you can’t help but love. I was tapping my feet to the fantastic Celtic rock music, and I had the best time. It is a must see...This show is very moving, and you might need tissues!"" ', '""It is a refreshing, warm, and very humane tale that attends to the lump that will be in your throat, and the tears of love and compassion that will run down your cheeks, by also putting a big grin on your face...This writing team does create the most musically lovely story about that day in the most humanly way possible...Beautifully staged by the creative team, \'Come From Away\' is one of the most singularly engaging new musicals to come to Broadway this spring."" ', '""An excellent ensemble of twelve play both the residents and the guests, changing roles faster than you can blink...The style of the music is mainly Celtic folk. Many of the songs sounded alike to my untrained ear. There is one lovely number where several passengers pray, each according to his or her custom....Christopher Ashley’s direction keeps things flowing smoothly...Judging from the audience’s enthusiasm, Broadway will welcome this feel-good musical."" ', '""A very entertaining musical that is given a near pitch-perfect production...The show is full of humor and a company of 16 talented performers play multiple characters with aplomb and warmth. Most of the music is sung in ensemble and is staged with imagination and skill...Much of the music sounds the same but it blends perfectly with the story...As the show progressed...something was tugging at me. This was 9/11...I felt almost a sense of guilt for being seduced by the show."" ', '""Without making a fuss or employing dubious dazzlements, stirs one to the core...Under Christopher Ashley\'s swiftly paced, emotionally astute direction, a company of only twelve portrays everyone with seeming effortlessness...There are moments when, in its portrayal of such universal goodwill, \'Come From Away\' flirts with becoming cutesy or too insistently upbeat; time and again, however, it steps back from the brink, reminding us that a world-shaking tragedy is taking place."" ', '""A big bearhug of a musical...Even the most stalwart cynics may have trouble staying dry-eyed during this portrait of heroic hospitality under extraordinary pressure...\'Come From Away\' is smarter than it first appears...The show covers a vast expanse of sensitive material with a respect for its complexity...It sustains an air of improvisational urgency, which feels appropriate to a show about making do in crisis, and it doesn’t linger on obvious moments of heartbreak and humanity."" ', '""Creators Sankoff and Hein have crafted a heartwarming and thoroughly entertaining musical...Despite the doubling and tripling of roles, the numerous characters are all vividly rendered, thanks to the skillfulness of the writing and performances...Although not particularly memorable, the music proves consistently engaging and serves the story line beautifully...Serving as a welcome reminder of people’s inherent goodness, \'Come From Away\' is the feel-good show of the season."" ', '""It is as simple in its focus as the acts of goodness and gratitude at its thematic core...It\'s not that \'Come From Away\' doesn\'t approach tricky themes, but without much agonizing, it shines a positive light on them...From tragic source material, \'Come From Away\' has wrought a work that emphasizes goodness and shared humanity. Whatever your cynicism levels around how that may sound on paper, resistance to the show-as-performed is pretty futile.""

', '“Somehow, ‘Runaways’ is not depressing, which it could have been in lesser hands. In fact, it’s enthralling - a fast and furious, poignant and disturbing 80 minutes.

As it is, every other number feels like a rousing finale. But how are you going to keep a lid on a cast with this much natural talent and vigor?” ', '“That one doesn’t walk out of the theater despondent is thanks not just to Swados’ canny use of rock, folk, and anthemic music, but even more so to the highly energetic direction of Sam Pinkleton, the freewheeling yet disciplined choreography of Ani Taj, and above all, the spirit of 25 young performers who deliver 80 minutes of passion and commitment...Even more now than then, it feels like the slightly misshapen love child of the Public’s biggest hits, \'Hair\' and \'A Chorus Line\'.""

Finding Neverland,"['""An enchanting evening awaits audiences...Directed with heaps of fairy dust by Diane Paulus...Finding Neverland is never better than when Paulus and her illusions team create honest-to-god magic through pure theatricality.

No matter how seasoned a theatergoer you are, Finding Neverland feels like experiencing your first Broadway show all over again, and you\'ll never forget it. "" ', '""Loaded for Tony nominations and overflowing with charm...Paulus is expert at whimsy, and so her London shivers with confetti blasts, and delights in oversized bicycles, red balloons, and a hallucinatory clock sequence that I want to see again as soon as possible."" ', '""“Finding Neverland” is a thoroughly enchanting new musical. Diane Paulus, the show’s current director, has kept this musical tale about J. M. Barrie’s creation of “Peter Pan” magnificently low tech...she creates magic not by being literal but recalling stage machinery that’s appropriate to the year of Barrie’s classic play, 1904...The rousing ensemble numbers could be lifted from a 1950’s musical...This production may not be total perfection, but it works real magic with its child’s play.""

They don’t mince their words.”"" ', '""Paulus is saddled with a lackluster score, mostly syrupy ballads and vaguely peppy production numbers. The book, by rising playwright James Graham, is better — hokey at points, but offering enough playful wit and compassion to make this story about the creation of Peter Pan fly.""

', '""\'Finding Neverland\' is a fairy tale steeped in magic. The magic stems not from the special effects, but from the delightful score by Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy; at times one would call it enchanting. The book by James Graham is a bit fussy and relies a lot on the obvious jokes...Director Diane Paulus does an admirable job of bringing the show together. Although not as exciting as her previous effort in \'Pippin,\' she does get the job done."" ', '""Finding Neverland flies. Occasionally it even soars...It\'s still too treacly and the tear-wringing ending just goes on forever. But there’s an audience for this show, which is visually cunning and something of a warm bath without being too insulting. It’s not for the Sondheim or the post-Sondheim crowd. It’s a sentimental throwback, unembarrassedly so.""

Directed by Diane Paulus, the production has a low-wattage wow factor that, though admirably true to the Edwardian period, mostly misses the chance to transform the fantasies in Barrie\'s mind with 21st century magic."" ', '""Harvey Weinstein made a bold and inspiring choice in hiring director Diane Paulus to helm his first Broadway musical...Unfortunately, Paulus\' own genius is to blame for ""Finding Neverland""\'s lack of pixie dust. This production is good but not great...For a musical about the creation of and featuring Peter Pan, one would expect flying and all sorts of theatrical razzle-dazzle. Those moments of wonder and awe are few and fleeting, though."" ', '""Director Diane Paulus coaxes compelling character portrayals. But the work fails to live up to the story\'s promise. Sure, there are lovely sprinklings of golden fairy dust and actors who take flight. But the music and lyrics by Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy too often lean towards syrupy ballads riddled with clichés."" ', '""It\'s at best a treasure chest of only mixed delights...It\'s not that the present cast and production creative team aren\'t working up to high levels...to gussy up the proceedings, the writers and director Diane Paulus turn to all sorts of diversions...since this is a musical, the score is the biggest disappointment.""

There\'s nothing wrong with that, it\'s just that each has its own tone. Sometimes Graham is deadly earnest, sometimes he\'s sly and often he\'s just trying too hard at both.""

The music and lyrics are redolent of pop-chart uplift and fail to contribute to character development.

The lapses are especially apparent because this is, at heart, a show about artistic inspiration.""  ', '""The flash doesn’t drown out the other aspects of the production. The acting is fine. The musical has funny moments and moving moments. The score mostly offers a sweet, bouncy British pop sound. There is nothing here outright to hate, and the attention to state-of-the-art stagecraft can be justified in a show that offers little real dramatic tension...But understanding the context results in a feeling of disappointment.""

Paulus and Company don’t trust intimacy and charm, so everything is overplayed — despite the advice to an actor rehearsing Barrie’s “Peter Pan” to go “smaller.” Peter Pan taught others to free themselves and fly...“Finding Neverland” remains stuck to the ground."".

Even Diane Paulus’ direction lacks effervescence, each moment so overwrought that each character seems to be wearing a light-up \'Applause\' sign.""

Not because the show is full of chuckles; it’s just that it’s enthralling to see Sondheim’s \'Pacific\' songs work so magically well.""

His bold production has the vision and clarity to do just that."" ', ""“Doyle creates lots of imaginative business, such as the precise snapping open and shut of fans by the men playing girl prostitutes in ‘Welcome to Kanagawa’...Doyle's production tears away so many visual elements that it endangers clear comprehension of the book's many transitions in time and place.

Doyle turns that flaw into a virtue...Every element of this \'Pacific Overtures\' allows us to savor the individual moments without demanding more than it is ready to offer...Letting the show flow in stately style from start to finish is revelatory, allowing the musical’s real balance to emerge and the focus to remain on the Japanese point of view.""

Thus, the weakening of Japan’s resolve against allowing entry to foreigners feels faster than it should...The austere tunes bear the weight of convincing authenticity, even when they run the risk of blurring into one another after awhile...Performing with the somber affect and measured pace Doyle is after, the cast members are uniformly good and true."" ', '""The tone and scale of the production are enthrallingly intimate, and the simplicity of the presentation means that the gorgeous score stands out in the highest possible relief...The ensemble cast is solidly competent...\'Pacific Overtures\' didn’t need to be cut by an hour, much less subjected to a politically tendentious rewrite...This revised version works superlatively well in its own way. For all my reservations, I wouldn’t have missed Doyle’s richly involving production for the world.""

One wouldn’t think so. But there is an elegance to the storytelling, a lovely culturally pointed design and directing point of view, some beautiful singing, and one can’t deny the Sondheim style...Musically, this piece is lovely and moving and the story being told is a fascinating slice of history."" ', '""With its reduced orchestra, modest singing style, and low-key spectacle, Doyle’s approach has its strengths. We really hear those dense lyrics; we lean in to appreciate the subtleties of the caste system. But this production, while scrupulously acted, seems to be having a conversation with itself, not the audience. There’s anger and irony in the material that dissipates in Doyle’s hermetic coolness…Mixed though the results may be, this earnest experiment proves the piece infinitely adaptable.""

Twenty years after his death, \'Tick, Tick…Boom!\' is a hopeful and fitting tribute.""

Silverstein obviously loves this material, but his direction is all over the place.

They spread warmth out across the auditorium.” ', 'for a previous production“David M. Lutken plays Woody with communal charisma...Lutken, as sympathetic in his down-home decency and grass-roots purity as his inspiration, colors all the warm notes in Woody’s haunting call to arms, ‘Why Do You Stand There in the Rain?’ It’s an odyssey of a hootenanny, as unflinchingly sincere as Garrison Keillor in front of a mike or Woody’s pals Pete Seeger and Leadbelly singing up a storm just by ‘always going on.’” ', 'for a previous production“Thoroughly enjoyable and effectively assembled...All four members of the cast are expansively competent, both vocally and instrumentally…Lutken and his crew bring home to us today just how valuable Guthrie and his music are to understanding the complexity of America’s past…Those who are close to young children owe it to them to take them to this production, if only as a way to help them better understand the history of the country they will inherit.” ', 'for a previous production“An amiable 90 minutes of melodies…The musicianship is first-class…The cast effortlessly adapts to the rousing spirit of the songwriter’s heartland balladeering and protest music…As presented here, though, Guthrie’s music is more seductive than antagonistic, often managing to express with dry-eyed humor the bitter experiences of the poor…The topical similarities of some of the songs do provoke a few yawns, but ‘Woody Sez’ says good night well before its welcome is worn out.”  ', 'for a previous production“Four talented, versatile musicians provide a low-key musical commentary-biography…The four musician-singer-performers happily breeze along with the breeze and melodies, having a great time on stage…Multi-talented, lanky David Lutken as Guthrie is refreshingly sincere, singing and strumming Guthrie’s tunes with gusto…Guthrie’s songs ring out today as loudly as they did when he wrote them.” ', 'for a previous production“Wholesome and homespun…With laid-back passion and gentle amusement, David M Lutken takes on the role of Guthrie…Much like Guthrie and his music, the production is low-key and easy going.

Gyllenhaal may be the main draw for ticket buyers, but this heavenly production is stronger than any one star."" ', '""Gyllenhaal is outstanding. The even better news is that he\'s at best the third most compelling thing on stage...The most striking performance in this revival comes from Annaleigh Ashford...The staging, by Sarna Lapine, is exceedingly straightforward...There is no coup de scenery, in the musical\'s gorgeous Act One climax...But the material is so strong, and the cast so good, that this Sunday remains deeply affecting...Like Seurat\'s painting, it is, and remains, a masterpiece.""

Gyllenhaal, however, is masterful in his own right....There is an essential nostalgia to the production that is belied by the uniqueness of its style. Indeed, there is no other musical like it, still it stands on the shoulders of all great musicals...Helmed by Sarna Lapine, there is genuine daring to her directorial concept, which underplays the romanticism of the musical composition...It is all simply divine!""

The complexity of Stephen Sondheim's work, and the way in which it mimics Seurat's pointillistic style, is a marvel.

You'll be shocked when you hear him sing.” "", '“Gyllenhaal brings an organic intensity to the role of George and nails Sondheim’s complex phrasing with aplomb…What makes ‘Sunday’ arguably Sondheim’s best musical is how it works seamlessly on different levels.

Twelfth Night,"['""A musical with enormous heart and smarts to match its considerable spectacle...Theater that truly looks like NYC...One of the tightest productions I\'ve seen from Shakespeare in the Park...Thoroughly delightful and heartwarming musical...Taub\'s songs are not only catchy but dramatically efficient, slicing through exposition and serving up objectives with a dexterity few other contemporary musical-theater composers possess...A truly stunning production.” ', '""Shaina Taub\'s joyful and sunny updated musical version of Shakespeare\'s comedy, \'Twelfth Night,\' is back in a full production courtesy of free Shakespeare in the Park and Public Works which premiered an earlier production for four performances during Labor Day Weekend 2016. This slightly trimmed and tightened version is even more entertaining and the witty contemporary lyrics make this fun for young and old, as well as Shakespeare veterans and novices."" ', '""At least as good as any of the new musicals that have opened in the past decade, and better than all but a handful of them. Indeed, Ms. Taub’s tuneful pop-soul score is reminiscent of a big-budget Disney show, only without the soul-shriveling slickness of a cold-hearted commodity musical like \'Frozen\'... I can do no more in this space than suggest its limitless pleasures, not the least of which is a fetching performance by Ms. Taub as Feste, who is an accordion-toting street singer."" ', '“Seeing such a diverse group of people onstage was inspiring...The highlight was the fantastic original score by Shaina Taub...She chose just the right spots to musicalize and her lyrics smartly jumped off from Shakespeare\'s text...A terrific marriage of text and music...I found this delightful, heartfelt and tuneful incarnation to be just the thing to see on a summer night...The performers were all terrific."" ', '""Taub has written music and lyrics for this adaptation, and the result is an absolute delight. Her work never meanders away from the play’s structure, but rather adds to the celebration, along with choreography by Latarro...The rest of the principal cast does their characters proud...\'Twelfth Night,\' among all of its flourish, evokes one word: joy. Every second is filled with it, from the silly machinations of the self-preserving Malvolio to Feste’s witty yet sincere commentary.""   ', '""If theatre be the food of love, the company played on, with the audience loudly cheering every quick reprise and dramatic exit through to the finale chorus, a heart-warming anthem of empathy extolling how much better the world would be if everyone just tried seeing it through the eyes of another...Despite the tremendous work by the theatre professionals, the highlight of any Public Works production is, of course, watching the community members of the ensemble."" ', '“Illyria has never been so welcoming...This freewheeling version...proves a consistent delight. Purists may blanch, but everyone else will be thoroughly charmed....Despite the broad humor on display, the adaptation doesn\'t stint on the piece\'s emotional power...It\'s the amateur performers who truly make the evening shine, their energy and enthusiasm at being onstage entirely infectious...There have been other musical versions of the play before, but none as giddily pleasurable as this one."" ', '""Taub’s score is Broadway-ready, and she is a smashingly good charmer of a performer...A veritable parade of delights...If the thought of a professional/amateur effort sounds worthy but somewhat academic, please obliterate that thought. Taub’s version can only be described as jubilant. By crowding 50 members of various community groups on stage, the entire place takes off. Amateurs, yes; but well-rehearsed, talented, and above all energetically engaged in every moment."" ', '""Get thee to the Delacorte before it is too late...A magical, festive, and highly accessible evening of Shakespeare that lifted my spirits, kept me grinning from ear-to-ear, and sent me out of the park and back into the concrete jungle of Manhattan with a pep in my step and a flutter in my heart...Musicals have a paradoxical power to simultaneously simplify nuanced ideas and heighten emotional resonance. The sacrifice of the former, here, is equally made up for by the pleasure of the latter.""

But who cares too much when we are so entertained?” ', '“Vibrant, contemporary and very funny...This colorful, spirited production is a joy from start to finish...Taub’s lyrics cleverly convey the Bard’s tale with a decidedly contemporary edge...So generous in spirit is this production that even the vain Malvolio gets a big, Broadway-style number, not to mention some respect and compassion."" ', ""“Shakespeare's unruly romantic farce is expertly trimmed down to a fast, funny, touching ninety minutes...Taub's songs effortlessly condense the action, revealing complicated emotional states and knotty plot points with ease...The production is loaded with delightful bits of business...Everyone has been thoroughly drilled and they appear to be having a ball...This version of Illyria seems like an earthly paradise.” "", '""A sweet alternative reality...summoned by Kwei-Armah and Eustis, and Taub...What they and their team have conjured is a Platonic ideal of the crazy salad that is New York City in the silly season...Taub and Kwei-Armah have extended the original play’s consideration of the ambiguities of identity to address an age in which the divisions between sexes and classes paradoxically feel both more porous and unbridgeable than ever....It’s empathy that makes this production feel like such a blessing."" ', '""I found the new version just as entertaining– but also improved as a work of theater....I saw the blue cast members, who were noticeably more streamlined and in sync than what I remembered from 2016, undoubtedly because of the extra time to practice.

', '“Entertaining, poignant and vital community-oriented theater...Integrating a catchy, pop-style score...’Twelfth Night’ is a fast-paced and accessible musical comedy adaptation...The professional performances are terrific...but the jubilant chorus is what is most striking and refreshing...Of the many productions of ‘Twelfth Night’ I have seen in recent years, this is by far the most bright and upbeat.” ', '“The production, a restaged version of the show...thumbs its nose at the weather and delivers its own deluge of pure delight...The acting, dancing, and singing skills vary among the ensemble members...Even with all the running around, the very large cast, and the outsized production numbers, it is very easy to follow the plot, which has been boiled down to its essentials and configured into a joyful romantic comedy in which all ends happily."" ', '""A downpour would begin anew, but the undeterred cast gallantly completed the show...There was so much fun being had that most of us could not be bothered to worry about being a bit soaked...The play lends itself to turning it into a romp in this free-wheeling, joyful conception...Hits the highlights of the play with the aim of providing sheer fun, thanks to the musical creativity, eager performances and an atmosphere that makes for delight in the park."" ', '""Gives off vibes of inspired nuttiness and celebratory sexual ambiguity...This latest updating...obliterates any memory of predecessors...Shaina Taub leads the orchestra with aplomb, plays the fool Feste with zip, and wrote the splendid songs which explore themes of gender switching and perspective. This infectious and fizzy spectacle rushes by in 90 minutes, a delicious summer cooler. What a pity it will gone soon. But that makes it all the more special."" ', '“A pared-back text and music and lyrics by the phenomenally talented Taub...The skill of Taub is to compose within and behind what already exists in the play. The makeover makes the characters more clearly understandable emotionally...Not only is every part of the stage used and splashed with color and activity, but, in the play’s final song, the evening’s overall theme is emphasized...Shakespeare at its most open-hearted and holistic."" ', '""How refreshing...to arrive at Central Park’s Delacorte Theater and enjoy a production that celebrates inclusiveness without reserve—and without pandering or preaching to the choir...Kwei-Armah, Taub and Eustis not only make \'Twelfth Night\' accessible to the breadth of audiences represented by their company—which includes kids—but emphasize the differences and contradictions that can exist within each one of us. And leave us laughing, and dancing, in the end."" ', '""This is no ordinary production of Shakespeare’s much-loved romance, and not just because of Taub’s impressive contributions...Purists will likely quibble with some of the liberties taken. Everyone else will have a great time watching the antics as Viola dresses in grief as her brother, setting in motion a tangle of misguided relationships, but finding herself in the process...The whole production speaks to promise wherever you look, most especially in Taub’s direction.” ', '""Although somewhat overcast with rain and thunderstorms in the forecast, the mood onstage for \'Twelfth Night\' in Central Park at The Delacorte Theater couldn’t have been sunnier!...Listen carefully to the words of Taub’s songs and you hear a 21st century sensibility, especially in terms of feminism and acceptance...The combination of amateur and professional in the cast provides unprecedented energy, enthusiasm and spirit on the Delacorte stage."" ', '""A top-notch cast which blends the talents of both professional and community performers...Though there has been some tidy contemporary-edge adapting to tie the story up into a comfy 90 minutes, the spirit of the musical is admirably true to its source material and is only enhanced by the diverse and delightful songs...The integrated eclecticism in choreography, music and design reinforces once again the evening\'s message of inclusivity. \'Twelfth Night\' is a joy from beginning to end.""

Beetlejuice,"['""A creative team that includes director Alex Timbers and his inspired designers David Korins (sets) and William Ivey Long (costumes), animate this parade of eccentricity with flair and great comedy technique that turns it into a subversive delight. The score by Eddie Perfect is full of wit and grit, and Scott Brown and Anthony King\'s book propels it forward smartly. There are also hilarious performances from Leslie Kritzer and Sophia Anne Caruso."" ', '""The musical is a theme park unto itself and a fun, offbeat roller-coaster ride from start to finish. It stands out as a superior adaptation for so many reasons, but mostly due to Brown and King’s clever book and outrageously effervescent performances by Brightman, Kritzer and Caruso, plus whimsical sets by Korins and over-the-top costumes by William Ivey Long...Director Alex Timbers holds everything together beautifully and gets noteworthy performances from the rest of the cast."" ', '""The retooling done since its out-of-town tryout in D.C. gives the latest film-to-musical adaptation fresh snap, surprises and (gasp!) even heart. Sure, the narrative becomes a bit of a cluster-muck in the second act — but mostly it’s just screamingly good fun...The plotting eventually goes completely off the rails, but keeping things entertaining enough are the off-the-wall humor, endless visuals and aural delights, tuneful music and wicked lyrics of Perfect."" ', '""\'Beetlejuice,\' as it now presents itself, is a loopy, nutty, loud, winning hoot. It’s still pretty tasteless, lewd and inappropriate too—just acceptably so...Kritzer’s performance is one of the comic cherries-on-top of the Broadway season...Yes, the show is an extremely long two and a half plus hours, yes it feels off-balance in places, but it is also shameless, big, bold, fun and brassy. This is the miss that may well become a hit.""  ', '""A very enjoyable, very self-aware, very slick, very tuneful, very constructed-to-please-the-crowds new Broadway musical...All of it builds to a perfectly, wonderfully, showbizzy good time...It’s those big performances that work best here — Jill Abramovitz, wonderfully ridiculous in a bit part as an investor’s vacant wife, is a standout — because the whole show is so big.""   ', '""Crafted from a group of creative minds who clearly love the source material...There are still second act problems and a song list void of any real bops, but it’s a fun time for the Burton novice and pure fan service for the Burton stans, thanks in large part to the titular puckish undead spirit breathing life into a Broadway experiment that could’ve been dead in the water...The real surprise standout is Kritzer’s Delia. A supporting role, yes, but one she blends with all kinds of comedy."" ', '""The show is a loving homage to a wonderfully weird original, reconceived for the stage with eye-popping design, full-throttle performances and a mischievous sense of fun...It\'s impossible to deny the virtuosic showmanship of lead actor Alex Brightman...The writers struggle to control the reins of their galloping narrative...The musical delivers a unique fan experience for lovers of the movie, and plenty of touches that Burton cultists will appreciate.""

Obviously the challenge was on having to compete with all the filmic effects, and thanks to scenic designer David Korins and the special effects creators, the imagery is truly dazzling. Besides Beetlejuice, the showcase character is Leslie Kritzer\'s ditzy Delia, and she utterly slays us with this off-the-wall performance. For all the talent here, the show suffers from sensory overload.""  ', '""Against considerable odds, the musical manages to surmount most of the hurdles it faces, even if, like that nasty-funny ghost at its center, for many it may ultimately overstay its welcome...The musical is considerably funnier than the movie...The director, the prolific Alex Timbers, might have profitably taken an editor’s pen to the cumbersome gyrations of the plot...Kritzer and Brightman aside, the performers are not given much high-fiber comic material."" ', '""Happily and improbably, \'Beetlejuice,\' directed by Alex Timbers, lays those problems to rest. (A pretty hectic rest, but still.) Where the show falters is in the more ordinary stuff of musical theater, story and song...The book writers, Scott Brown and Anthony King, have plenty of good lines, but they haven’t really decided what story they want to tell...Eddie Perfect’s songs are forgettable...And yet somehow, impossibly, \'Beetlejuice\' is pretty fun."" ', '""True to its source material, it’s loud, it’s cheeky, and it’s all about excess. It’s also—thanks in large part to Alex Brightman’s spot-on performance as the incorrigible titular ghoul—a pretty fun time...The truth is we’re not here for the sweet stuff; we’re here for the mayhem, and the show is at its best when the growling, grinning Brightman is onstage...The musical is supposed to have twin engines, Beetlejuice and Lydia, but only the first is fully firing.""  ', '""This reworked incarnation, under Alex Timbers’s direction, breathes slightly more enjoyably even as it remains too faithful to the pumped-up inclinations of book writers Scott Brown and Anthony King and composer-lyricist Eddie Perfect...On the seriously plus side, two inferior songs have been cut from Act 2...It will never be among my favorite musicals, but I bet there will be a healthy and less-encumbered cheering section for it in New York."" ', '""There’s plenty worth a haunt here, from David Korins’ off-kilter spook house set to Alex Brightman’s raspy-voiced title performance and, most of all, the deliriously gorgeous singing of young Sophia Anne Caruso, and it all comes within reasonable reach of exorcising the bad vibes that attached themselves to the production during its pre-Broadway run in Washington D.C...The book retains the best bits from the movie without adding much of lasting value.""

"" ', '""This problematic adaptation of Tim Burton\'s 1988 cult movie hit doesn’t really know what to do with itself...The actors give it their all, but like Brightman, they are often guilty of overselling...The visuals are terrific...But the show only comes alive when it reverts to the Harry Belafonte songs everyone remembers from the film.""    ', '""Alex Timbers’ production looks suitably Burton-esque while also attempting to give more of a backstory to the characters. Despite lots of solid laughs, some clever fourth-wall-breaking, and some strong performances, the middling rock-pop score and the unwieldy, sorrowful storyline sap some of the vitality from the original...Burton’s film was a macabre joy, but this \'show about death\' doesn’t quite hit the mark. It never quite finds the right mixture of funny and creepy, lurid and light."" ', '""If you can tolerate the bombardment, and don’t mind sappy scenes mixed in with the comically macabre plot, \'Beetlejuice the musical\' does have its pleasures – principally a few standout performances and especially the vivid visuals...Few of the songs by Eddie Perfect are anything more than serviceable in \'Beetlejuice,\' though the lyrics can be clever and funny. They can also be puerile and profane...Yet, one aspect of \'Beetlejuice\' does stand out — its design."" ', '""This show so overstuffs itself with gags, one-liners and visual diversions that you shut down from sensory overload...Brightman and \'Beetlejuice\' can indeed sustain this anything-for-a-laugh intensity. And it is not a trait that benefits from prolonged exposure...Here, everybody, including every member of the support cast, has already gone so far over the top that there’s no room for comic contrast. The disheartening moral of \'Beetlejuice\' is that when anything goes, nothing much registers."" ', '""Another charmless, dumbed-down musical adaptation of a well-known movie...The production is a flashy and freewheeling visual treat...The cast is solid, including a pepped-up and gravely-voiced Brightman, assertive Caruso and delightfully dorky McClure and Butler. By not taking it seriously, \'Beetlejuice\' may very well offer a reasonably fun time at the theater. But don’t we expect better than that?"" ', '""The design of \'Beetlejuice\' is the most exciting of the season...It\'s hard not to wish that the rest of this disappointing new musical were up to their level of creativity. Instead, book writers Scott Brown and Anthony King and composer Eddie Perfect have created a show that\'s at odds with its own existence...While Timbers and the design team have done a masterful job building the world of this cult classic for a new medium, the writers haven\'t cracked it even slightly."" ', '""For whatever inexplicable reason, it turns out that Lydia can actually see Beetlejuice - even though she\'s not dead - they become temporary partners in mayhem, trying to exact revenge of Charles and Lydia, while also gaining what they really, truly want. Those objectives give the show whatever heart it possesses, and it might beat more steadily if Timbers and company let the show come to a simmer now and then, rather than keep it at a constant boil."" ', '""Brightman is a marvel by being blatantly gross. He manages to captivate even when his wink or grimace signals that the jokes are dead on arrival...Eddie Perfect’s score for \'Beetlejuice,\' however, is hands down/slit your wrists the worst of the season...Alex Timbers directs Caruso to resemble Millie Perkins in \'The Diary of Anne Frank,\' only slightly more sanctimonious...Leslie Kritzer does rise from the dead of this six-feet-under production.""

', '""The show once again proves its brilliance, with Sondheim’s ear- and soul-filling score and the poignancy of its intention overcoming whatever clunky defects remain in its unconventional storytelling...That energy, with the cast pared down to just six terrific performers under the inspired direction of Noah Brody is one of the key elements making this redo such an exhilarating experience...The score has been thinned but with no feeling of disruption."" ', '“An exuberant, engaging production...’Merrily’ is a perfect fit for this company of theatre artists who came of age together since their university days...Brody directs with skill and verve and the company shines...Fiasco has put its collective heart and soul into this production.""

But on the whole...theatrically effective, smart and emotionally wrenching...Most critical to its success, the production brings to the forefront the three-way friendship of Frank, Mary and Charley and conveys the overwhelming insecurity of every character.” ', '""Basically succeeds, even though this is a pared down version that still could stand more editing. It has been deftly re-imagined in the direction...and with new orchestrations and arrangements...An excellent cast is sufficiently appealing to make one care for the characters...The revival is enjoyable to watch, as well as reminding us of how creative this Sondheim work is despite the book’s complexity.” ', '""Under the seamless direction of Noah Brody, it\'s largely a success...Sondheim’s score, thanks to a terrific eight-piece band, sounds beautiful as ever with lyrics that paint the most detailed portraits in a single verse. If the performers don’t all have the most trained voices, they are first-rate actors who deliver each song with great clarity and naturalism. Some problems remain; the dialogue can sound stilted...But so strong is this company, we hardly notice the book’s flaws now.""

Fiasco, may not have solved all the show's problems, but the innovative company has come up with an entertaining, enjoyable production that revitalizes the bittersweet story...Trimming the cast to a tight ensemble of six fine performers doesn't really help, but supplementing with material from the original source does clarify the action.” "", '“Brody directed this revival with nice touches cleverly embracing and winking at the reverse chronology...The entire cast is solid but admittedly not all are virtuoso singers.

With all the leads unlikable from the start, it is an uphill battle for the ensemble to win the audience’s hearts and minds. And even though the final scenes are spirited and uplifting, they are also classically tragic since the trio’s fate has already been determined...The supporting cast has an easier time of it."" ', '""Fiasco Theater is giving it their best shot, attempting to find the true heart and pacing of \'Merrily\'...The Fiasco team have attempted to tighten up the material, treating the piece like a new show in development...The tightening has cost the show a bit of its connect-ability, forcing the highs and lows of emotionality to come too quickly...The subtlety has been chopped away, leaving an emotional rollercoaster...The killer songs are performed with passion but not so much power.""

', '""Even though the cast has been stripped down to six, the stage feels as full as those shelves because of the well-paced staging...The central role of Frank could be played with more charisma and some of the other actors’ line readings are overly glib, but I felt \'Merrily\' was worth the ride this time, as a heady exercise in the pitfalls of thinking the past used to be better—except that it really was. Except for 1981."" ', '""It\'s both easier to follow and more clear where the holes in the story are. But the cast, though they occasionally have unsteady voices, brings a warmth and poignancy that feels fresh...Maybe this is as good as it gets — six entangled characters who hurt themselves as they try to thrive.""

', '""Though vocalizing is not this production\'s strong suit, Fiasco puts them over with their special flair...But for all the clever touches and Latarro\'s peppy choreography, the many lovely songs are still attached to a structural gimmick that viewers of the large cast version found too confusing...I rather doubt that the strong acting, inventiveness, charm and stylishness, will turn Sondheim\'s major flop into a belated major hit likely to move to Broadway. But there\'s plenty here to enjoy."" ', ""“Fiasco’s earnest love for the material is evident...And the cumulative effect is…pretty good. Despite an abundance of appealing parts, this 'Merrily' doesn’t quite come together into a real gut-punch of a whole. There’s much that’s nice some that’s very funny, and a bit that’s beautiful, yet the show’s emotional power feels blunted and its aesthetic suspended somewhere between minimalist and maximalist. There’s no shortage of spirit on offer, but visceral oomph is elusive.” "", '""Brody\'s casting choices also have their plusses and minuses...on the up side, those actors, many of whom have been collaborating since their college days, put to good use the comfortable familiarity and knowing frustrations that come from their own long association. They\'re also clever at integrating into their stagecraft the Fiasco trademarks of inventive stage business...Here\'s a significient negative: their vocal strengths vary from impressive to not-all-that-great.""

They also manage to endow the slender characters with all the believable passion Furth’s dialogue lacks...\'Merrily\' remains the problem child of Sondheim’s creations, but it does contain one of his loveliest scores."" ', '“This cast brims with nerve, energy and overreach...Though in this production...Brody has a keen eye for revelatory details that perk up scenes and deepen characters...Both Narayan and Steinfeld have the strongest voices in the cast and deliver on their numbers big time...Vocally, the rest of the cast just isn’t up to the task. And while some details of the script are enhanced in the staging and the playing, others are diminished.” ', '""One issue for some people might be in the manner of narration of the play...Somewhere along the line, some plot lines get blurred and lost...Perhaps in shortening the play, some of the storyline has been deleted...It is interesting that only Mary changed over the 25 years.

', '""Felder is a wonderful pianist with a virtuosity that is thrillingly played with subtle nuances. As a writer, he brings a deep knowledge of music history, so that by the end, we feel as if we know who Leonard Bernstein the man was. He sings the pieces with passion and flair...Director Joel Zwick adds a darker side, which is forceful and very much like the man himself. This man was arrogant, brilliant, conflicted and highly complex. Mr Felder manages to bring all that plus compassion."" ', '“Hershey Felder’s stunning tribute to the life and work of Leonard Bernstein is a work brimming with affection and respect…Mr. Felder bristles with energy as he darts from chair to Steinway grand piano  sharing Bernstein’s life and legacy with an impassioned commitment to transparency and authenticity…Kudos to Hershey Felder and director Joel Zwick for creating and presenting a memorable and bittersweet bio-play of one of America’s greatest talents."" ', '""Felder doesn’t need more than a piano, a chair, lighting, a few slides and the excellent direction of Joel Zwick to work his magic...Despite his oversize ego, Bernstein is always human and often funny. Felder makes Bernstein a fine mimic. And his Yiddish accent is impeccable. However, even without the outstanding writing and acting, the opportunity to hear Felder play not only Bernstein, but also Gershwin, Copland, Wagner and many others is a sheer pleasure."" ', '""I wondered who to admire more – the subject of this bio-play or the remarkable artist who wrote and performed it...With skill and care, Felder has compressed Bernstein’s moving life story into an exhilarating show...What makes Maestro soar is the sublime music...Watching Hershey Felder’s charismatic, passionate, transforming performance, one senses there is a lot of \'Lenny\' in Hershey."" ', '""A delight…It is such a rare opportunity to see the combination of great acting, singing, conducting, and piano performance…It is an inspiring tale, coming from a playwright who deeply understands the soul of music, and not just its tuneful melodies. Felder is clearly someone who truly loves music and is able to capture, in words and stories, the transcending, life-changing qualities of great music from our past masters…This is a fascinating play, a must-see even if you are a beginner to music.""

Moments of this kind of singular beauty have become increasingly rare in contemporary theater…This writer, an admitted Bernstein fanatic who was already fully aware of all the important events, still found himself sitting on the edge of his seat.""

In \'Maestro,\' the ideas are rich and the music compelling and joyous."" ', '""Felder\'s performance gets at the torment of an artist chasing too many muses, wearing his soul out in the process. A fine pianist, Felder adds resonance to the proceedings by playing various excerpts...If \'Maestro\' largely amounts to a brisk guided tour of Bernstein\'s life, it powerfully suggests the intoxicating effect of music on a complex character torn between creative and self-destructive impulses; as such it is far more dramatic than so many solo biographical plays."" ', '""Beautifully directed by Joel Zwick, the work uses projection and lighting as well as audio in striking, even brilliant ways...In bringing us a character whose passion and achievements were in music, Felder’s own musicianship, his teaching moments riffing on music that occur throughout the play, and his prowess at the keyboard, bring us more deeply into the soul of Bernstein than this genre might have otherwise permitted."" ', '""Felder is a gloriously gifted mimic. The portrayals of each new character are remarkably specific, colorful and detailed...Two elements are missing...The wit, passion, anger and regret are all present. The audience just never gets the big, joyous bombast of the man. The scenes involving his personal life, his marriage and his children are curiously flat. The passion–and there is much of it–is all in the music...Overall, this is an absolutely mesmerizing piece that I would recommend."" ', '""What begins as a fairly dense talk on music theory transitions into something much more personal...Felder fully commits to the kind of broad and ballsy choices necessary for a good solo show. That still doesn\'t alleviate the falseness that creeps into the play...But if Felder\'s portrayal of Bernstein feels occasionally inauthentic, his musicality is the real deal...In the end, the showmanship of \'Maestro\' compensates for the messiness of the script."" ', '""An enjoyable narrative with some wonderful music...Felder\'s not looking or sounding like Bernstein doesn\'t really matter since he frequently segues into other key figures...He handles the singing and stage presence required to do so competently...Whatever the shortcomings of the script and Felder being a truly compelling Lenny, he deserves credit for giving equal time to the compositions that Bernstein was so eager to have appreciated as much as his more popular theater scores."" ', '""The play and Felder are better when they abandon the pretense and strip away the theatrical excesses...Felder has no trouble making him surface-level compelling, so the evening is not hard to watch, and it\'s frequently enjoyable as far as it goes...But it\'s tough to worry too much about whether Bernstein has found his particular immortality through \'second-rate\' compositions when, in his own story, he\'s willing to come across as a supporting player."" ', '""Felder’s approach to his life is mainly chronological and gamely attempts to cover many aspects: conductor, educator, social activist, bisexual and flawed husband. The early scenes with his father, speaking with a heavy Yiddish accent, were embarrassingly stereotypical...The musical clips were frustratingly brief...There was a brief moment near the end, in which Bernstein lashes out at the world, that gave me a sense of how much more powerful the piece could have been."" ', '""Mr. Felder doesn’t have the magnetism of the musician who inspired a generation of artists...The music that Mr. Felder plays, quite nicely on a gleaming grand piano, is the best part of this show, which at an intermissionless 105 minutes is both overlong and insubstantial...The script lacks the necessary grace, but \'Maestro\' has some amusing moments...Mr. Felder never manages to slip into Bernstein’s skin, though...It’s a surface-skimming survey of a fascinating life."" ', '""We travel on a genial journey through Bernstein’s life, as the show moves from one incident or encounter to the next without offering any potent glimpses into Bernstein…This lack of depth and habitual glossing over significant incidents in Bernstein’s life prevent the audience from getting a really clear picture of the man…With a little more focus, ‘Maestro’ could be quite compelling, but as it stands now, it doesn’t penetrate into its subject matter nearly enough.""

I’d rather celebrate what is there...A tour de force that fuses speech, song and pianistic brilliance into a captivating vignette of one of the towering figures of 20th century American music. It’s also hilarious at times, and awe-inspiring in Felder’s unfolding of a compelling narrative while hitting every note of a varied, complex and difficult score...Felder handles the story’s many moods with grace and versatility.""

He certainly plays a good deal in \'Maestro\' but to his great credit, he\'s walked away from the stuff he finds easiest...Felder has more material than he has time to present and the show falters in the last few minutes...But \'Maestro\' remains this talented performer\'s most revealing, and certainly most moving, piece of work."" ', 'for a previous production""Bernstein\'s biography is easily the most fascinating, complex and thought-provoking of the theatrical portraits, and Felder delves deeper into Bernstein\'s tortured psyche than he went with the 1999 debut piece on Gershwin...It\'s a gripping portrait, studded with fine performances of Bernstein\'s most famous and obscure compositions. Felder\'s a stronger pianist than a singer, but he sings with passion and conviction, so it works well enough.""

The Legend of Georgia McBride,"['""A stitch-in-your-side funny, if improbable, new comedy...The performances, under the snappy direction of Mike Donahue, are, as might be said backstage (or onstage) at a drag show, totally flawless...Most impressively, while drag queens have practically become stock characters in pop culture, Mr. McGrath imbues his version with a life-hardened authenticity underneath the garish wig and the cracking makeup; there isn’t a trace of caricature in his portrayal.""

The title character makes a legendary leap into very unfamiliar territory to regain his sense of purpose and his determination to accept who he is.""

But its relentless silliness is sweet and amiable enough to make it go down easy...Despite its earnest message of tolerance, \'The Legend of Georgia McBride\' is too lightweight to register as anything more than a mild diversion. But it\'s highly entertaining nonetheless.""

', '""This play could serve as a textbook example of a guilty pleasure. Its plot is as predictable as a Swiss train and as deep as a thin mint, but its appeal is hard to resist...This slender material is greatly enhanced by a terrific cast, outlandish costumes, even more outlandish wigs, an appropriately seedy set, hilarious choreography and smooth direction.You may not remember it five minutes later, but you are likely to have a good time."" ', '""If Lopez takes you few places unexpected, he brings such a luscious, biting wit to it all that the patina of freshness is unmistakable throughout...Once Georgia is established, Lopez injects a lengthy montage...But the segment is overlong, and neither insightful nor eye-poppingly absurd...The play is able to survive — and even thrive — in spite of briefly mistaking external fiction for internal fact. And as long as Lopez is in tune with that, which he is most of the time, his play borders on... ', '""This 100-minute comedy is the sweet-natured surprise of the young season. The fun is in Lopez\'s theatrically knowing dialogue and Mike Donahue\'s lot-with-a-little direction...The five actors are all shrewdly delightful, but the galvanizing center is Matt McGrath...Lopez tosses in a little message about gender and nonconforming, but even the lecture is entertaining.""

', '""A sitcom-heavy play, which delivers plenty of one-liners but rarely goes below the sequined bustier in terms of character development...There are plenty of well-earned laughs in \'The Legend of Georgia McBride,\' and while the play pays honest homage to one aspect of gay culture and attempts to transcend its impact by telling its story through a straight man’s viewpoint, its false eyelashes and high heels occasionally mask truths still waiting to be told.""

The production features silly-glam costumes and snappy one-liners for the queens, an amusing learning-curve montage for our hero and several zippy musical numbers, including a delightful show-tune medley...Presented in 100 straight minutes, the play seems like a truncated version of something fuller and more specific. The foundation is there; the shading needs work."" ', '""It’s charming, but this play ducks the complicated questions...The storyline feels somewhat canned, especially as the play veers away from anything too controversial. Casey’s heterosexuality is never in doubt and while the play scolds him for lying to his wife about his female impersonation, the play never dares suggest that it does anything but make him a better husband, father and provider...The play wimps out, leaving questions of gender and sexuality uncomplicated and unexplored.""

"Lolita, My Love","['“Nearly fifty years after its initial commercial failure, \'Lolita, My Love\' in its current form is revealed as a well-crafted musical theatre piece with fine wit and attractive melodies. Perhaps that\'s not enough to get it to Broadway, but it\'s certainly enough to earn a visit to The York\'s excellent production."" ', '“An intriguing, cohesive musical framed by modestly prodding psychiatric sessions...The play is unnecessarily lengthy...There are clumsy/unnecessary songs. Still, lyrics are articulate, more often clever than...clunky...An operetta-like piece with gravitas...The show is attractively staged, its chorus adroitly-if too often employed, characterization credible. Casting...is splendid...Director Emily Maltby endows the piece with a plethora of wonderful moments.” ', '“There’s a reason this show closed out of town. The unsavory material resists rehabilitation...The musical is heavy, imbalanced, and way too long...The cast does its best, but they cannot shift this material into second gear...\'Lolita, My Love\' does have a couple of good songs...’Lolita’ should be an opera...It demands texture and depth. As a musical, it is impossible to find the balance between weighty material and palatable composition."" ', '""Maltby, works thoughtfully and well, maintaining a good pace during a lengthy, exposition-heavy first act...She has a stunning Humbert in Sella, who handles his ballads in achingly controlled fashion...\'Lolita, My Love\' constitutes a daring stab at the impossible, and all thanks to the York for letting us finally get a look at this sometimes brilliant, often misbegotten work. It offers living proof that some failures are more interesting than some successes.” ', '""It is definitely worth this fresh look in the concert style staging...The difficulty with the work—and I speak of the musical itself, not this presentation—is that as it grows more and more complicated and serious, Nakokov’s satirical vision is overshadowed, and the right tone that we experience in the first act, is lost. Although there still are some good numbers that Lerner wrote, the story turns primarily nasty...An interesting attempt to make a musical out of a difficult subject."" ', '“The performance was captivating, full of freshness and vitality...Lerner’s lyrics are witty and worldly, laced with sly satire. Most noteworthy, the performance...was like a master class in how song and book work consistently hand-in-hand...Even alone at the piano, Cordell expressed the pleasing rhythms and harmonies that imbue Barry’s marvelous score...An unexpected and perfectly entertaining and edifying afternoon of American musical theatre.” ', '""After seeing this musical, I completely understand why it failed. The production and the York do a superb job of this material, but it is incredibly hard to watch...Some of the songs in Lolita are catchy and the First Act is definitely better than the Second...Sella does his best to make us understand his plight while sounding glorious...Maltby does a wonderful job at directing this piece and keeps it flowing and palatable...For me it is just too much to take when done in song."" ', '""The York Theatre Company is to be applauded for taking the risk of staging this famously controversial musical in its New York premiere. As Alan Jay Lerner is one of the legendary giants of the musical theater, it is a pleasure to be able to see this lost musical in a workable version. However, despite the excellent staging of director Emily Maltby, \'Lolita, My Love,\' the casting still seems problematic and the musical is ultimately disappointing."" ', 'The writing\'s smart and enveloping, as we\'d expect from a master like Lerner; it\'s just about something profoundly disturbing. Maltby\'s direction, clarifying the truth vs. Humbert\'s version of it and framing the action is a huge help. So is Sella. His Humbert is wonderful casting...The subject matter is just too upsetting, and even Haagensen\'s expert blending of drafts can\'t obscure some structural liabilities."" ', '""There’s much to admire in director Emily Maltby’s presentation...Lerner’s book is turgid. The run-time of three hours is too long. It’s as if he forgot he was writing a musical with long patches of exposition without song. And some of the songs are snippets versus full numbers...\'Lolita, My Love\' is best for those who must see the entire Lerner cannon or the theatrically curious.""

Hamilton,"['""Yes, it really is that good...I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show.

He\'s created a work sure to be enjoyed by generations to come, proudly drawing on America\'s past as a guiding light to the future. It unequivocally asserts that the revolutionary ideals of 1776 are still valid in 2015. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, destined to change Broadway forever.""

It’s a powerhouse three-hour telling of this pushy historical figure...Act One is an adrenaline-fueled history lesson in politics, war, revolution and love but Act Two is the clincher, which gives this show its emotional core and depth.  It is truly amazing what Miranda has done here."" ', '""This innovative show is shaping up to be just as much of a phenomenon uptown, playing in a Broadway house with four times the seating capacity, and to a more traditional but no less enthusiastic audience. That universal appeal to crossover audiences is one unmistakable sign of a groundbreaking show...Like any true landmark, \'Hamilton\' stands up to repeated viewings. After six months, the show’s initial impact hasn’t dulled a bit; in fact, the qualities that made it so extraordinary the first...

Yet it succeeds...It\'s a deeply moving saga, made more so by the fact that it is never over."" ', '""A work of mingled genres and strong flavors...By and large Mr. Caplan is a noisy treasure...Overwritten, the book and lyrics both. It’s alternately sentimental and lewd and strains too hard for universality, spelling out its metaphors in marquee lights...Still, it succeeds. A near catastrophe teaches Chaim and Chaya to care for each other, and it teaches us to care for them, too.""  ', '""Shows about immigrants are hardly new ground in theater, but they’re seldom as bewitching as the Canadian import \'Old Stock.\' This quirky one-act musical—more like a concert with accompanying dialogue—uses playwright Moscovitch’s Jewish-Romanian great-grandparents’ refugee romance in early-20th-century Montreal as the framework for a series of rollicking neo-klezmer songs...Caplan sells this old family folktale as our collective history."" ', '""Weatherstone and Coady bring the unlikely and mismatched couple alive in performances that allow memory to leak across moments of joy, fear and anger...The most crucial element is the singing and dancing narrator of the show, played by Caplan...His exuberant performance blows the musical out of the dark waters of its painful story and brings in intellectual parody and social commentary alongside its musical range and eclecticism...Moscovitch draws her characters with a sure touch."" ', '""Would be much better with a bit less of the ubiquitous Caplan…and more emphasis on having Weatherstone and Coady enact the Moscovitch story, so much of which is Caplan\'s responsibility…It\'s a well-performed musical celebration of a particular refugee couple\'s experience, one roughly similar to countless others. Many, I\'m sure, will find the show deeply moving. I admit it mostly missed my heartstrings but I could hear it zinging those of my refugee plus-one."" ', '""Weatherstone and Coady are just Jewish enough to be believable. Happily they do not move into the swarmy stereotypes that overwhelm us with fabricated emotion. Caplan, with his unruly beard and grin of an evil clown, could have stepped directly out of a Brecht-Weill musical or a Berlin cabaret."" ', '""A different kind of theatrical experience. Conceptually, it\'s beautiful: a cast and set that emerge from a giant shipping crate, a klezmer score...a penetrating script sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek moments, and an entertaining narrator/front-man with a powerful voice...In practice, it\'s less than perfect...If this metaphorical crate hasn\'t quite reached its destination yet, maybe it\'s simply like its characters: flawed, but searching for - and occasionally finding - real human connection."" ', '""On the other side of this show are the songs, which are klezmer infused with hints of bluegrass, but they seems separate from the story...They border on commentaries trying to connect now to then, which doesn’t work. The music however, is well played...This is one talented cast...Mary Fay Coady and Chris Weatherstone are so believable that we follow their story and sigh as sigh of relief when things turn around. They make this tale touching and relevant."" ', '""Hard to classify. Is it a play enhanced by songs or a song cycle interrupted by dialog?...Caplan is both the best and the worst thing about the piece. He has a powerful distinctive voice and a strong performing presence that threatens to overwhelm the quiet story of Chaim and Chaya. His music, often klezmer-infected, is easy on the ears...While both the drama and the music are worthy of our attention, they seem to some extent to be at war with each other."" ', '""Caplan, a true showman, has a dynamic voice and is entertaining to watch...It\'s unfortunate that the book and song scenes aren\'t more balanced, but when they all play together, the show really comes alive...There is one section about euphemisms for sex that goes on too long, becoming less and less funny, but apart from that, it\'s refreshing to see a show dealing with religion that is so upfront about sex."" ', '""A perspective we rarely see in the musical genre: It does not take place in America, but Canada...Where the piece falters is in its own sense of place. Moscovitch\'s script is on the quest for universality, but it skirts around the show\'s single most interesting (and different) aspect: its setting. Why did these Romanian émigrés decide to settle in Canada?...\'Old Stock\' feels like a cool first draft of a work that is daring enough to think outside the box but not to really dig deeper."" ', '""What\'s also surprising is the number of times that The Wanderer states something, only to add that, \'This isn\'t real,\' and then to contradict himself again, saying, \'That\'s a lie.\' It makes for an extremely unreliable guide, navigating us through the long saga of these two Romanian refugees, culminating with a long list of their many offspring: \'eight grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren.\' But in the end, what exactly are we to believe, given the many contradictions in what we\'re to...

The larger, full-cast numbers were not harmonious or united but cumbersome, and everyone was far too over-the-top…I hope over time they come together and raise this show up again.” ', '""There\'s Vernon\'s well-greased knack with writing this sort of pastiche material from the era\'s musical forms...The performing company is a trip, too...It just doesn\'t add up to much other than a sort of vampy, revamped \'A Chorus Line\'...For all its flash and filigree, the writing never transcends its basic subject matter to become about something bigger...\'The View UpStairs\' would have a greater impact if Vernon were more interested in learning from history than in merely repeating it."" ', '""A lot of disparate characters to pack into a one-act musical, which may be why they\'re painted and (mostly) played in such broad strokes under Ebersold\'s unsubtle direction...Clearly a passion project for book writer, composer and lyricist Vernon.

As a result, audiences leave with a song on their lips, a smile on their face, and even a tingle in their heart.""

She acted her way through each and every moment. I knew I was going to love the music, but this time I really connected with the character and her struggle. This show is so much more than just a jukebox collection of great songs. There is a wonderful story full of wit and pathos.” ', '""Jessie Mueller strikes a delicate balance between spunk and humility, making it impossible not to root for her as she morphs into an inspired Carole King.""

Although I had never heard of any of the present leads all were competent if not loaded with charisma...With 27 songs to squeeze in, there is no room in book for much more than connecting the dots...Bruni’s smooth direction keeps things moving...The singers were overamplified almost to the point of aural pain...If you like the music, you will probably have a good time.” ', '""McGrath, director Marc Bruni and the appealing performers don’t exactly break that mold by going for complexity. But while keeping things light and breezy, they have populated Beautiful with well-defined characters with relatable human foibles."" ', '“More than two dozen amazingly catchy songs of yesteryear are heard throughout ‘Beautiful’ as McGrath’s smart script nimbly relates how King, still in her teens, and Goffin, scarcely older, teamed up to turn out hits...What makes ‘Beautiful so, well, beautiful is watching King evolve from a dowdy, insecure teenager into a confident, mature artist...The show looks fresh in performance, thanks to a versatile, highly energetic ensemble.” ', '“The script is snappier than I remembered...Music-wise, the biggest thrill is hearing contrasting versions of songs you know and love...The switches between the writers’ and the pop stars’ renditions, thanks to director Marc Bruni, are quick and polished; and, even more important, the music, thanks to orchestrator/arranger Steve Sidwell, sounds dynamite...You’re bound to recognize all these songs...but please, for the sake of your fellow Carole King–loving audience members, don’t sing along.""

In other words, it should have a long and healthy run, if, the producers can either convince Jessie Mueller to remain in the title role forever or if they can find replacements as enormously talented as she is."" ', '""King made magic with her catalogue and it is an unqualified treat to hear her best-known hits  performed live...Too bad a great musical isn’t only about the music. The book is crucial, too — and this show’s connect-the-dots story line is so simplistic that the extravagantly talented King’s life emerges as a mundane version of the long-suffering little woman."" ', '""Director Marc Bruni and the design team keep things moving at a brisk pace. The show is tightly directed and seamlessly flows from the songwriters to the pop artists that shared their work with the world.  The hard-working ensemble takes on these musical icons, and while they look and sound incredibly polished, there is a decidedly “Broadway” sound to their vocal delivery."" ', '""An entertaining blend of charm, nostalgia, and showmanship. The show’s overall feel and musicality will resonate greatly with a generation of baby boomers...While the book provides a cohesive plot and allows for a firmly developed point-counterpoint between the songwriting teams, the overall results for \'Beautiful\' are problematic."" ', '""The early life and career of legendary singer-songwriter Carole King surely deserves more imaginative treatment than the corny chronological storytelling and old-fashioned musical format of “Beautiful.”  But all is forgiven, whenever Jessie Mueller, in the modest person of Carole King, sits down at the piano and pours heart and soul into familiar favorites from the composer’s songbook."" ', '""Though Beautiful is ultra-slick and impeccably executed for what it is, electrifying it is not."" ', '""Mueller\'s portrayal of King — far and away the best reason to see Beautiful.""

As he tells us at the beginning of the show, there may have been greater theater talents, but it would have taken 12 people to combine all of the things in which he excelled. ‘Life Is for Living: Conversations with Coward’, a sophisticated and scintillating evening of music, verse and wisdom is a fitting tribute to The Master and a delightful show for those who cherish the perfect bon mot.” ', '""Yes, an argument can be made that Coward’s drinks-party sophistication, for which his cigarette holder is a perpetual synecdoche, runs so deep here that it just about reaches the genuinely philosophical...\'Life is for Living\' may only be 70 minutes in length, but it’s appreciably more in breadth and depth. Destiny’s tot himself would be grateful for the cleverly presented perceptions."" ', '""Artfully blends music and theatrics along with some of Coward\'s personal conversations and correspondences. Coward\'s extraordinary musical talent, wit, and wisdom are wonderfully depicted...Bravo to Green for his dazzling performance as Coward. His vocal talents are complemented by Shrubsole\'s outstanding piano accompaniment...The show will give you a true sense of Coward\'s personality and his brilliance...An insightful, entertaining show."" ', '""Green’s appreciation of Sir Noël Peirce Coward shines throughout this suave and well-heeled tribute to Coward from start to finish…What might have been fine-tuned is the assumption that everyone knows the breadth of Coward’s work...Shrubsole’s lyrics and music, completely inspired by Coward’s letters, words, and diary extracts, combine with Green’s vocal interpretations to create a deep, powerful portrait of Coward…The staging is beautifully rendered."" ', '""Mr. Green is a tall, nice-looking gentleman with a poise, presence and demeanor that is tailor-made to represent, if not impersonate, the aura of Sir Noel. He segues from text to tune with artful and obligatory precision and sings well enough and at times very well, indeed...Green gets major and marvelous assist from his accompanist and composer David Shrubsole who doesn\'t miss a beat following Green\'s breezy and purposely fluid narrative."" ', '""An artistic collaboration and co-creation of love...Green is a British actor who has instant heart connection with his audience and a pleasing voice...The wonder of the show is in its perfectly pitched performance and thoughtful selections of Coward songs and text...Best, of course, are the songs, which include old favorites as well as little-known gems...This show reminds us of the sensibility, depth and linguistic virtuosity that have ravished us for nearly a century."" ', '""Green exudes wit and charm. Green has specialized in Coward and, while not trying to do a direct imitation, captures Coward’s high-brow tone. It is exceedingly pleasurable to watch Green channel the late multi-faceted star with simplicity and an ultra engaging manner…He keeps the program simple and nimble, and in the process we learn much about Coward’s life and thoughts on a variety of subjects."" ', '""Mr. Green is not performing an act of mimicry; he is not playing Coward himself, but interpreting his songs, and reciting from the diaries and letters, in a style that recalls the \'master.\' His voice is neither large nor particularly rich, but his phrasing has the lightness and drollery, and the occasional bite, that’s ideal for Coward...I most enjoyed Mr. Green when he was on home turf, bringing a cool romantic ardency to Coward’s wistful love songs, or a lightly savage humor to songs."" ', '“It would be so much better if the skimpy narrative were to consistently connect the dots, succinctly indicate just what that conversation is, and how these particular selections contribute to it. Instead, the linkages jump from subject to subject and the transitions often seem arbitrary...Audiences should be prepared simply to appreciate the pieces...Green radiates casual British charisma, sophistication, wry humor, melancholy, and occasional archness.” ', '""Mr. Green sings Coward in his own way not trying to imitate...But attempting this extraordinary fusion unfortunately results in a hodgepodge of songs and often unrelated albeit interesting excerpts from Coward’s diaries and letters...Green and Shrubsole are indeed very lively...The evening becomes a vehicle for Mr. Green’s vivacious and entertaining singing rather than an evening enlightening us about Coward, yet, I must add, skimming the surface of intentions delightfully."" ', '""Green skims lightly over Coward’s life and art as a playwright, matinee idol, songwriter, bon vivant and embodiment of stiff-upper-Englishness. The performer’s light tenor nicely evokes Coward’s early recordings, but serves less well for later, more acerbic items. With light, crisp diction he navigates Coward’s twisty, rhyme-packed lyrics, but his comic attack is too gentle. And Green seems determined to elevate Coward’s brittle, slightly misanthropic humor with melancholy wistfulness."" ', '""Too many settings sound alike. Readings and monologues are often quite wonderful...The artist, like Coward, is elegant. There are genuinely touching and lighthearted moments. Shrubsole’s accompaniment and background music (to spoken verse) is respectively sensitive and spot-on. In this show, however, he is more successful with other composer’s melodies. I admire these artists, but am disappointed with their latest effort."" ', 'You already adore Coward, or are waiting to fall in love with him.

', '""Classy revitalization of an old, presumably boring property that proves to have plenty of life in it yet. The upscale revival should bring a tear to old-timers with romantic memories of the original schmaltzy score, while titillating newbies...The production values alone are a jaw-dropper...And just wait for his big getaway in \'The American Dream,\' a show-stopper—and a career-maker for Briones."" ', '""The new \'Miss Saigon\' is as hypnotic in its storytelling as it is overwrought in depicting its small tale of five people caught up in events beyond their control. As one might expect from one of the blockbuster British musicals, everything about it is huge. Luckily time has made its underlying theme of the fate of refugees caught up in war both relevant and immense too."" ', '""The helicopter may not be completely the real thing but with the help of lighting and strong fans, it\'s still pretty amazing...Using that spectacle factor and the quality of the singing as a baseline to judge whether \'Miss Saigon\' holds up, the answer is \'yes.\' This is the biggest, most spectacle-rich show in town...Noblezada sings with enough feeling to touch even the most cynical members of the audience...Current events make this new production as sadly timely as it is entertaining.""   ', '""Sure, it\'s a brash, broad-strokes saga with questionable racial and gender representation and a taste for salacious vulgarity. But although director Laurence Connor has adhered to the basic contours of the original, his grittier approach exposes teeth in the material that I don\'t recall previously being so sharp...Noblezada is a legitimate discovery, just as Salonga was the first time around...This is brawny, crowd-pleasing entertainment."" ', '""\'Miss Saigon\' soars to the rafters...Director Laurence Connor has darkened the tone considerably...Casting is key in this production...Young Eva Noblezada, discovered while in high school, is quite a find with the instincts of a seasoned veteran and the vocal range to match. With Alistair Brammer as Chris, the doomed lovers raise tragedy to epic proportions...This is a most worthy revival, and now, minus the controversy, fans are free to re-live the thrill."" ', '""Connor directs the cast with high stakes, amplified to reach the last row of the balcony. But within this amplified reality, Noblezada can carry your heart in the palm of her hand...You’ll feel like you’ve gotten your money’s worth with \'Miss Saigon‘s\' flashy production design. But once you’ve left the theatre and the stage goes dim, it will be \'Miss Saigon’s\' haunting score and timely reflection on how war impacts the human spirit that will stay with you."" ', '""The new revival of \'Miss Saigon\'...is lavishly produced...And I must have really gotten old because I enjoyed it a lot more than in \'91, when I found it screechingly cheesy. This time, there are still some clunky lyrics and also people belting songs while writhing in melodramatic anguish. But the story grabbed me...As the dramas unfurl, Laurence Connor’s direction keeps things swirling, with some dazzling set pieces, including Jon Jon Brione’s brilliant turn as the Engineer."" ', '""The show retains everything that made it noteworthy in the first place: Schönberg\'s ear-worm melodies, a massive ensemble of attractive dancers, and a helicopter landing onstage...Connor has opted for the more-is-more approach...When you look beyond the hulking scenery and \'American Idol\'-style glory notes, you can see \'Miss Saigon\' for what it really is: a bruising indictment of American self-pity in an age in which we still control the lion\'s share of wealth and power."" ', '""This bracing new production from London reminds that whirlybirds can’t whip up emotions. Only good actors can do that. The revival has plenty of them...Noblezada impresses Kim. She sings from a deep well of emotion and gets under your skin...Briones brings sleaze and sly humor to the role...His gritty take on \'American Dream\' is a highlight. Too bad he’s also saddled with a gratuitous \'Make American great again\' line. It mars the show\'s otherwise fine-tuned return."" ', '""This production is sensational in every way: visually and sonically (often painfully so). Most important, it’s brilliantly cast...\'Miss Saigon\' is a show that eats its cheesecake and has it too, like a skin flick that runs a banner at the end promising to donate proceeds to a home for wayward girls...The show’s high point, \'The American Dream\'...is more chilling than I’ve ever seen it...The production’s other big discovery is Eva Noblezada...Noblezada radiates conviction."" ', '""Eva Noblezada has an enormous, poignant strength and a piercing voice that can delicately float as confidently as it blasts. Alistair Brammer has the voice, the jaw and the muscles of a gentle American giant...The story feels more urgent amid renewed refugee tragedies and our consciousness of the sex trade. And the narrative—helped by unusually graceful lyrics—almost distract from the generic Euro-pop ballads and anthems that sound like many we’ve heard before."" ', '""The spectacle still impresses. There\'s the lush orchestration...; a ferocious paean in dance and song...; and, of course, the helicopter...The standout in this show, though, is Eva Noblezada as Kim...She isn\'t matched by the more opaque performance of Alistair Brammer as her lover Chris, though perhaps his part is just underwritten...But one doesn\'t go to \'Miss Saigon\' for a tight narrative. It\'s an evening of big Broadway, with music that will move you and set pieces that will thrill."" ', '""The story packs an unavoidable emotional punch, even if you do see it coming, largely due to the performance of Ms. Noblezada...She simply nails all of it...Briones is doubtless giving the best performance of his long career...The large cast is uniformly excellent...The design elements are appropriately impressive...The pop-rock score is sometimes tepid and often repetitive, but when it has to soar it does so, usually on the wings of Eva Noblezada’s beautiful soprano voice."" ', ""“This blockbuster is bulletproof against critical assaults on its...mawkishness, racial stereotyping, melodramatic overkill, and substantial lack of comedy...Still...it's hard to deny the show's ability to zing theatregoers' hearts...Briones, who's played the Engineer in multiple productions, captures his treacherous survivalist instincts without losing audience sympathy. He helps make this an entertaining, if unexceptional, revival of a show whose problems have become more apparent with age.” "", '""True to its operatic source, the sung-through drama of \'Miss Saigon\' is better conveyed via its sweeping, power-ballad-driven music than by its lyrics...Nevertheless, strong performances keep the proceedings stimulating, particularly that of Jon Jon Briones, especially charismatic as The Engineer...Powerfully voiced Eva Noblezada combines sensitive nobility and naiveté as Kim, and Alistair Brammer\'s rocker-belting Chris effectively displays the steady growth of PTSD.""  ', '""An elaborate staging, which at times vies for attention with the talented cast...Briones is the focal point of this \'Miss,\' part-character and part-narrator, emceeing his way across Asia with gyrating hips and snarky asides...Noblezada is effective...The helicopter scene remains phenomenal...My issues with \'Miss Saigon\' aren’t deal-breakers: the orchestrations sometimes unintentionally subvert the presence of the actors. And the initial bond between Kim and Chris isn’t sketched out enough."" ', '""The show is completely sung-through, which was common in the ’90s but feels a bit dated today. Further, much of those songs are sweeping, melodramatic ballads...Eva Noblezada is probably the show’s biggest wow (sorry, helicopter)...In general, this new iteration has a more appropriately gritty feel than the show had in the ’90s, from the physical set to the portrayal of Americans and the consequences of war. Still, it’s a pretty darn schmaltzy show to begin with."" ', ""“Schönberg's score is unfailingly melodic, but it doesn't add the requisite gravity and dramatic heft to such potboiler plotting. This is not for lack of trying…The lyrics are distressingly generic. It doesn't help that the characters are mostly one-dimensional and prone to dramatic flip-flops…Still, if you're a fan of ‘Miss Saigon,’ this is a first-class revival, both in terms of its cast and production values.” "", '""As a primer on the megamusical...\'Miss Saigon\' has just about every ingredient required: high emotion, universal themes, hummable songs, visual enormity, dazzling and often mechanized spectacle...A nobly committed cast...Megamusicals in general just don\'t do it for me, but that\'s not to say that the production isn\'t done very, very well. If you like shiny romantic sappy bigness and don\'t mind two-dimensional characters that threaten to dip into stereotype, the show just might be yours.” ', '""The production’s impressive visual spectacle, lively staging and crowd-pleasing vocal calisthenics cannot completely mask a script that leans heavily on emotional manipulation and one-dimensional storytelling...Perhaps a miraculous cast could take such blunt-force emotional instruments and soften them into credibility...If the new \'Miss Saigon\' is powerful, it’s because of the powerhouse singing...In fairness, the revival delivers on the thrills that its fans are surely expecting."" ', '""Here it comes again just about exactly 26 years after its first landing. It huffs and puffs and settles itself awkwardly but tenaciously...Throughout, everything possible to be done to overwhelm the patrons has been done. So congratulations of a sort go out to Connor for directing with power...As to the performers: Briones is a marvel. He’s a reason to see this bloated whip-up. Noblezada, Brammer and Clarke are all fine, but curiously, their singing is pitched at a strange adolescent level."" ', 'you want to see the best that Broadway has to offer.

A Bronx Tale,"['""From an outstanding score by Alan Menken, touching and cohesive book by Chazz Palminteri, the effervescent choreography by Sergio Trujillo and an award-winning cast, \'A Bronx Tale\' has it all. \'A Bronx Tale\' is an old-fashioned musical, done the way musicals used to be with heart, soul and just a little bit of schmaltz. It is exactly what the doctor ordered in these trying times. You will get your money’s worth in entertainment and will leave feeling good about the world."" ', '""A stunning new musical that combines realism with just the right amount of moral ambiguity and rich enduring questions to make a delicious theatrical event worth seeing once if not twice...Mr. De Niro and Mr. Zaks provide rich direction to the ensemble cast and keep the action moving forward at an appropriate pace. The realistic conflicts of each character drive a believable plot full of wonderful dramatic surprises that give the story interesting twists and turns."" ', '""Clearly Mr. Palminteri’s biographical play has served him well, and now his good fortune is being spread to a marvelous group of featured actors and a gifted ensemble. It’s a dark tale, at first glance seemingly hardly the stuff on which to base a Broadway musical. But every choice in fashioning it into a very good musical  has been the right one…The conflicts are the building blocks that make this a solid story, told without compromise, a first-rate drama."" ', '""An emotionally driven musical that takes the movie on which it is based to a deeper level...The perfect telling of a moving and riveting story. The second act builds to an emotionally powerful climax. The cast creates characters who you want to embrace. They tell a tale that you wish would never end...If you liked the movie, you will love this musical. If you’ve not seen the movie, go see this show right now! It will fill your heart."" ', '""It doesn’t break ground or dazzle with an unusual recipe, but it delivers reliable pleasures with polished professionalism and infectious energy...If there’s a secret ingredient that gives the musical version a zest, it is the wonderful score...Certainly not without its formulaic or sentimental aspects. Few mainstream musicals are. But it captures both the milieu it evokes and the colorful characters who populate it with a buoyancy and humor that ultimately won me over."" ', ""“‘A Bronx Tale’ at the Longacre Theatre has its pleasures and delights, particularly if you have never seen Chazz Palminteri's original insightful monologue. Adding songs by Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyrics) to Palminteri's book doesn't expand on the original but merely buff the rough diamond that was the original into a glitzier version. The original depended on Palminteri's brilliant acting and the imagination of the listener to picture the Bronx in the sixties.” "", '""\'A Bronx Tale\' does exactly what it sets out to do: paint a loving picture of a bygone era with bittersweet hues...Palminteri’s pastiche of seemingly outsized characters, which anyone who witnessed the era would tell you are, amazingly, completely accurate; and catchy numbers which evolve with the times, combine to make \'A Bronx Tale\' an immersive, realistic trip down memory lane.""

But \'A Bronx Tale\' is nevertheless an entertaining crowd-pleaser and a poignant piece of theater...There is a heartwarming aura to the storytelling and a palpable sense of sadness lurking under the nostalgia...The staging is tight and high-powered. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater have built a fresh and flavorful score.""

The boy’s Act Two romance with a black girl bogs down a bit in too many misunderstandings, and there may be too many songs about following one’s heart, but still, the creative team did a sturdy job in making this project sing.""

There are a couple of songs that are standouts, but given the time and the place, they could have mined the rich vein of American music that included doo-wop and Motown…The music tends toward traditional Broadway show tunes...The artistic choices made in this production have almost without exception been the wise ones."" ', '""All these actors are great, singing and dancing up a storm, and giving us a totally solid show. This solidness is maybe the only complaint I have with this show. It is so well done, a total professional piece of musical theatre, but somewhere along the way it fails to be something special. I can’t say that I didn’t enjoy myself at any given moment, but I was never swept away...There doesn’t seem to be any stand out numbers."" ', '""Because it resembles an urban fairy tale, Palminteri’s story works even better as a musical than it has in its earlier incarnations where its stereotypical aspects felt more glaring...\'A Bronx Tale\'—in the second half, packed with a succession of melodramatic incidents—can feel rushed and unconvincing...While the score doesn’t feature any breakout songs, it is tuneful and fun...Though hardly sophisticated entertainment, \'A Bronx Tale\' has genuine charms.""

The dance numbers in particular need more space to breathe."" ', '""It is serious stuff; but in this musical universe, it’s leavened with humor, music, dance and good fun.

The choreography is energetic...All the characters feel three-dimensional, and the performers are all first-rate...\'A Bronx Tale\' provides a fun night in the theater.""

', '""Cordero\'s sinister yet charismatic gangster-in-chief contributes mightily toward making this singing and dancing \'A Bronx Tale\' an enjoyable musical entertainment...While the show has been given a sugary Disney gloss, the score is easy on the ears and the lyrics advance the story and include showstoppers...Slick, colorful and tuneful as it is, the overall feel and those echoes of \'West Side Story\' do place this into pleasing but standard Broadway musical territory."" ', '""Too many of the songs are inconsequential, which serves to dilute those ingratiating, low-brow, mob-infused charms which won audiences over in the first (and second) place...\'A Bronx Tale\' is unlikely to work without a strong performance in the central role of the gangster Sonny. Fortunately, Nick Cordero carries the musical with aplomb...\'A Bronx Tale\' gets a passing grade, and might well prove a crowdpleaser; but \'Jersey Boys,\' it’s not.""

And Trujillo\'s dances make all the right moves...The show\'s MVP is Nick Cordero who plays the charismatic mobster Sonny.""
